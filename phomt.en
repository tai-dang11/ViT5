Brother Albert Barnett and his wife, Sister Susan Barnett, from the West Congregation in Tuscaloosa, Alabama
Severe storms ripped through parts of the southern and midwestern United States on January 11 and 12, 2020.
Two days of heavy rain, high winds, and numerous tornadoes caused major damage across multiple states.
Sadly, Brother Albert Barnett and his wife, Sister Susan Barnett, 85 and 75 years old respectively, were killed when a tornado struck their mobile home.
The United States branch also reports that at least four of our brothers' homes sustained minor damage, along with two Kingdom Halls.
Additionally, the storms caused major damage to a brother's business property.
Local elders and the circuit overseer are offering practical and spiritual support to those affected by this disaster.
We know that our heavenly Father, Jehovah, is providing comfort to our brothers and sisters who are grieving because of this tragedy.
International government agencies and officials have responded to Russia's Supreme Court decision that criminalizes the worship of Jehovah's Witnesses in Russia.
These statements have criticized Russia's unjust and harsh judicial action against a minority religious group known for peaceful religious activity.
On July 17, 2017, a three - judge panel of the Appellate Chamber of Russia's Supreme Court upheld the Court's April 20 decision "to liquidate the religious organization 'Administrative Center of Jehovah's Witnesses in Russia' and the local religious organizations that are part of its structure to turn over to the Russian Federation all property of the liquidated religious organization."
With this decision, the Court effectively banned the worship of Jehovah's Witnesses throughout Russia.
The following are excerpts of statements made after the July 17, 2017, decision by the Appellate Chamber of Russia's Supreme Court to uphold the April 20 ruling:
We are deeply concerned by the decision of Russia's Supreme Court to reject the appeal of the Jehovah's Witnesses against their labelling as' extremists. '
This ruling confirms the criminalisation of the peaceful worship of 175.000 Russian citizens and contravenes the right to religious freedom that is enshrined in the Russian Constitution.
- Lord Ahmad of Wimbledon, Minister for Human Rights, Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Great Britain.
The Russian Supreme Court's decision this week against the Jehovah's Witnesses is the latest in a disturbing trend of persecution of religious minorities in Russia.
We urge the Russian authorities to lift the ban on Jehovah's Witnesses' activities in Russia, to reverse the closing of the Jehovah's Witnesses Administrative Center, and to release any members of religious minorities that continue to be unjustly detained for so - called 'extremist' activities.
- Heather Nauert, Department Spokesperson for the U.S.Department of State.
"Jehovah's Witnesses, like all other religious groups, must be able to peacefully enjoy freedom of assembly without interference, as guaranteed by the Constitution of the Russian Federation, as well as by Russia's international commitments and international human rights standards."
- Spokesperson for the European Union External Action Services.
The Supreme Court's decision sadly reflects the government's continued equating of peaceful religious freedom practice to extremism.
The Witnesses are not an extremist group, and should be able to practice their faith openly and freely and without government repression.
- Daniel Mark, Chairman of the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom.
I am very concerned by the fact that the court ban on Jehovah's Witnesses in Russia has been upheld.
Despite our appeals on a number of levels, this move makes the peaceful enjoyment of the right to freedom of religion and thought a criminal offence.
- Gernot Erler, Coordinator for Intersocietal Cooperation With Russia, Central Asia, and the Eastern Partnership Countries, Foreign Ministry of Germany.
Russia's recent outrageous decision to ban the Jehovah's Witnesses from existing as a recognized faith community in Russia is a complete violation of the protections for freedom of religion and belief in Article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
People of goodwill from all faith communities as well as all those who cherish freedom of conscience rights must stand in solidarity with the Jehovah's Witnesses of Russia.
- Dr.Katrina Lantos Swett, president, Lantos Foundation.
Prior to the Appellate Chamber's decision, numerous government agencies and officials condemned the Russian Supreme Court's April 20 ruling:
"I asked President Vladimir Putin to use his influence to guarantee minority rights here as well as with Jehovah's witnesses."
- Chancellor Angela Merkel, during a news conference with President Putin.
"The recent decision of the Supreme Court to declare the Jehovah's Witnesses Administrative Center in the Russian Federation an extremist organisation, and to close it down, together with the 395 Local Religious Organisations used by Witnesses, raises serious concerns regarding freedom of religion in Russia and is another example of the legislation against extremism being abused to curtail freedom of expression and assembly."
- Theodora Bakoyannis and Liliane Maury Pasquier, co-rapporteurs of the PACE Monitoring Committee for the Russian Federation.
Russia's failure to respect religious freedom is yet another inexcusable violation of Moscow's OSCE commitments.
People who practice their faith peacefully should never be in danger of being harassed, fined, or jailed.
The court order to seize organization property owned by Jehovah's Witnesses adds insult to injury.
I am hopeful that this case will be appealed to the European Court of Human Rights.
- Senator Roger Wicker, Chairman of the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe.
Yesterday's decision of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation to ban the activities of the Administrative Centre of Jehovah's Witnesses in Russia on grounds of 'extremism' could make it possible to launch criminal prosecutions against Jehovah's Witnesses for mere acts of worship.
Jehovah's Witnesses, like all other religious groups, must be able to peacefully enjoy freedom of assembly without interference, as guaranteed by the Constitution of the Russian Federation as well as by Russia's international commitments and international human rights standards.
I'm deeply concerned by this unwarranted criminalization of the peaceful activities of members of the Jehovah's Witnesses communities in Russia, eliminating this community as a viable entity in the country.
This Supreme Court decision poses a threat to the values and principles that democratic, free, open, pluralistic and tolerant societies rest upon.
- Michael Georg Link, Director of the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights.
This ban persecuting peaceful persons for mere acts of worship clearly violates the fundamental right to religious freedom and with it international human rights standards as also guaranteed by the Constitution of the Russian Federation.
It therefore needs to be revised as soon as possible.
- Professor Ingeborg Gabriel, Personal Representative of the OSCE Chairperson - in - Office on Combating Racism, Xenophobia, and Discrimination.
I am alarmed by the decision of Russia's Supreme Court to recognise the Jehovah's Witnesses as' extremists'.
This ruling effectively criminalizes the peaceful worship of 175,000 Russian citizens and contravenes the right to religious freedom which is enshrined in the Russian Constitution.
The UK calls on the Russian government to uphold its international commitment to this basic freedom.
- Baroness Joyce Anelay, former Minister of State for the Commonwealth and the UN at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.
On July 20, 2017, the Permanent Council of the OSCE adopted a statement from the European Union (EU).
The statement calls on Russia to allow Jehovah's Witnesses to "be able to peacefully enjoy freedom of assembly without interference, as guaranteed by the Constitution of the Russian Federation as well as by Russia's international commitments and international human rights standards."
The statement was unanimously adopted in Vienna by all 28 member states of the EU, and other non-EU member countries such as Australia, Canada, and Norway have aligned themselves with it.
Jehovah's Witnesses worldwide are deeply disappointed that with its arbitrary decision, Russia's Supreme Court has effectively banned their worship throughout the country.
In their responses, international government agencies and officials expose Russia for unjustly declaring Jehovah's Witnesses "extremists" and for ignoring its own constitutional and international commitments to protect religious freedom.
The European Court of Human Rights has yet to hear this matter and will hopefully reverse the nationwide ban.

Dismantling Saigon's Binh Trieu tollgates finished
As of Monday afternoon, November 2, the HCMC authorities finished dismantling the Binh Trieu 1 Bridge and Binh Trieu 2 Bridge tollgates in Thu Duc District, which had been nonoperational for four years.
The HCMC Infrastructure Investment Company, investor of the build - operate - transfer (BOT) Binh Trieu Bridge – phase 1 project, put the tollgates into operation in 2005 and shut them down in 2016.
The company maintained the tollgates instead of removing them as it planned to use them for the Binh Trieu Bridge – phase 2 project.
However, the city authorities decided to suspend the BOT Binh Trieu Bridge – phase 2 project in 2017, therefore the tollgates had been left nonoperational since then.
The nonoperational tollgates were identified as one of the causes of traffic congestion in the city, especially during rush hours.
Accidents have been caused by the tollgates as distracted drivers crashed into them.
Following the suggestion of the HCMC Department of Transport, in July 2020 the Roads Management Center has been assigned to the task of removing the tollgates in order to reduce traffic congestion in the area.
15 Chinese, Vietnamese crew missing after Panamanian vessel sinks near central coast
Rescue forces are searching for 15 Chinese and Vietnamese crew of a Panamanian ship that sank off Binh Thuan Province today, December 17th.
The ship, carrying clay from Malaysia to Hong Kong, was in the Binh Thuan sea area at 4:30 p.m. when its captain contacted border guard forces of Phu Quy Island to inform them that the vessel was tilting due to the clay leaning on one side of the ship, the Binh Thuan border guard force said.
Fifteen crew members – 11 Chinese and four Vietnamese – were on board.
But while it was about 1.5 nautical miles away from the Phu Quy Port, the ship tilted hard and sank.
Emergency signals for rescue were continually broadcast from that point.
The Binh Thuan border defense force and the Phu Quy search and rescue station dispatched ships to the scene to rescue the crew members.
But no one was found as of 6:30 p.m.
Despite rough seas and strong winds near the island, the search is ongoing.
The search radius has been expanded to three to five nautical miles from the scene of the accident, and additional ships have been deployed.
There seem to be myths and superstitions about nearly every aspect of life, and this includes physical attributes.
Moles, for example, were considered evidence of guilt during the Salem Witch Trials.
And among the Chinese, the shape of your nose is said to reveal whether or not you will be wealthy.
There are also a host of fascinating myths about our present topic: birthmarks.
Birthmarks are n't exactly a rare phenomenon.
In fact, about 80% of us are born with these seemingly random markings on our bodies.
There are several different kinds of birthmarks.
As well as brown pigmented types of birthmarks like moles and café au lait spots, there are reddish vascular types ranging in color and form from tiny, pink marks that are flush with the skin, to dark red puffy sorts.
All these reddish (vascular) markings are caused by blood vessels that lie close to the surface of the skin and show through.
Even though we know that the blood vessel - clumping makes a birthmark, we do n't know why this happens in the first place.
And this is where all the myth, mysticism and juicy superstition comes in.
First on the docket is the maternal impression myth.
This theory suggests that if a woman experiences an especially strong emotion during pregnancy, her baby may be born with a birthmark.
Not only that, but if the woman touches a particular location on her body while experiencing the emotion, that is where the birthmark will appear on her baby's body.
In Iranian lore, meanwhile, it is believed that if a woman touches her stomach while watching a solar eclipse, her baby may well have - you guessed it - a birthmark.
Other myths center around the colors of food.
For example, if the baby ends up with a red birthmark, it is supposedly because the mother wanted to eat strawberries while she was pregnant.
But, if she wanted to eat jelly or beets, her baby gets a port - wine stain.
Chocolate cravings, meanwhile, apparently lead to light brown café au lait spots.
Beyond being a result of pregnancy cravings and gazing at eclipses, birthmarks are also said to be omens about people's lives.
If, for example, you happen to have a birthmark on your right arm, you're sure to be prosperous; but, if it's on your left, you're going to have to pinch some pennies.
Elsewhere, a left - foot birthmark means the person will be massively intelligent, while if it's on the right, they'll love exploration, adventure and travel.
Some birthmarks are also supposedly linked with your manner of death in a previous life.
Is that creepy or what?
Whether or not you put any stock in these myths and beliefs, they can certainly be a lot of fun to learn about - and possibly exploit.
Inventing a story about your death and reincarnation is sure to be a great conversation piece at dinner parties.
Or, you can explain the presence of a certain mark by claiming that your mother desired to stroke a goat with her pinky toe while she pregnant with you.
Stranger things have happened.

(New York) Vietnamese authorities have detained, interrogated, and even tortured Montagnard refugees and asylum seekers who have returned to Vietnam from U.N. High Commission for Refugee (UNHCR) camps in Cambodia, Human Rights Watch said in a report released today.
The government is violating an agreement with UNHCR, which is supposed to monitor returning refugees and ensure they are safe.
Drawing on eyewitness accounts and published sources, the 55 - page report, "No Sanctuary: Ongoing Threats to Indigenous Montagnards in Vietnam's Central Highlands," provides fresh information about ongoing religious and political persecution of Montagnards, or indigenous communities, in Vietnam's Central Highlands.
"The Vietnamese government continues to persecute Montagnards once they are out of the sight of international observers," said Brad Adams, Asia director at Human Rights Watch.
"The international community should oppose their forced return to the Central Highlands as long as the authorities continue to persecute them."
Human Rights Watch urged the U.N. High Commission for Refugees to review its participation in promoting and facilitating voluntary repatriation, given the disturbing accounts of mistreatment of returnees, as well as weaknesses in UNHCR's monitoring mechanisms.
It also called on the U.S. government to keep Vietnam on its list of "Countries of Particular Concern" for religious freedom violations, and urged Cambodia to continue to provide temporary asylum to Montagnards, in line with its obligations as a signatory to the 1951 Refugee Convention.
Vietnamese officials continue to force Montagnard Christians to sign pledges renouncing their religion, despite passage of new regulations last year banning such practices.
Authorities in some areas restrict freedom of movement between villages – in particular for religious purposes not authorized by the government – and ban Christian gatherings in many areas unless they are presided over by officially recognized pastors.
More worrisome, the Vietnamese government persists in criminalizing peaceful dissent, unsanctioned religious activity and efforts to seek sanctuary in Cambodia, by arresting and imprisoning Montagnards who engage in those activities.
The most harshly treated are evangelical Christians who belong to independent or unregistered house churches and supporters of a non-violent movement for the protection of, and greater control over, ancestral lands.
More than 350 Montagnards have been sentenced to prison since 2001, largely for peaceful political or religious activities.
Most have been charged under Vietnam's Penal Code with vaguely worded national security crimes. These include "undermining the unity policy," "disrupting security" and "causing public disorder".
More than 60 Montagnards have been imprisoned after being forcibly returned from Cambodia, where they were seeking asylum.
The arrests are ongoing: during 2005 alone, at least 142 people – some of whom had been in pre-trial detention for as much as a year – were sentenced to prison terms of up to 17 years.
This is more than double the number imprisoned during the previous year.
At least 30 of those sentenced in 2005 had been arrested in Cambodia or near the border areas.
They were apprehended by Cambodian police and turned over to Vietnamese authorities without having a chance to make an asylum claim with UNHCR.
The report includes an annex listing Central Highland prisoners.
"Serious problems persist for Montagnards in the Central Highlands, and the Vietnamese government continues to gloss them over," said Adams.
For those who think the problems are all in the past, they should think again.
The report includes disturbing testimonies from Montagnards who returned to Vietnam in 2005 from U.N. refugee camps in Cambodia, but then "doubled back" to Cambodia after undergoing harsh treatment in Vietnam.
They describe in detail being detained, interrogated and even tortured upon return to Vietnam.
They also tell of being pressured to recant their religion and threatened not to report any abuses to international delegations and U.N. monitors.
Despite this, UNHCR has made repeated public statements that returnees are under "no particular threat or duress," and that it has "no serious concerns" about the government's treatment of them.
Human Rights Watch called on the Vietnamese government to allow UNHCR full and unfettered access to the Central Highlands, as well as private and confidential meetings with local residents and returnees.
The government should also ensure that there will be no retaliation against those with whom UNHCR meets, or their family members.
"These eyewitness accounts make it clear that some returnees have been tortured and persecuted for their religious and political beliefs," said Adams.
We have given this information to UNHCR.
But it has continued to send people back without the unfettered and confidential access to returnees it needs to protect them properly.
Returnees interviewed by Human Rights Watch gave precise accounts of serious threats and intimidation by Vietnamese authorities prior to visits by UNHCR monitors, who have often been accompanied by Vietnamese government officials and police, and are unable to meet privately with returnees.
Returnees were warned by authorities not to say anything negative to UNHCR officials.
One returnee, who had been beaten and pressured to renounce his religion in police custody, told Human Rights Watch, The UN asked about any mistreatment, but I was too afraid to answer.
I told them I had not been hit or threatened.
I did n't dare tell them I'd been sent to prison, if I told, would have beaten me.
"Meaningful monitoring can not take place in front of Vietnamese officials, or when villagers are threatened not to talk," said Adams.
The UNHCR monitoring missions and the repatriation program are seriously flawed and need to be reconsidered.
These testimonies, which were shown to UNHCR in January 2006, call into question the credibility of its monitoring of returnees and the assumptions on which the memorandum of understanding relating to repatriation is based: that returnees will not be persecuted and that UNHCR will be able to monitor the treatment of returnees to ensure that they are not harmed.
More foreign manufacturers turn to Vietnam amid pandemic: JLL
With the novel coronavirus pandemic and trade tensions driving the shift of production lines from China to Southeast Asia, Vietnam, in particular, seems to have emerged as an attractive destination for investors and manufacturers alike, according to Jones Lang LaSalle (JLL) Vietnam.
The real estate consultancy said in a recent statement that multinational manufacturers have been setting up operations in Vietnam for a number of years and this trend is poised to strengthened.
This movement has accelerated over the past 12 - 24 months, with companies looking to diversify their operations and supply chains due to tariffs on goods exported from China to the United States.
Stephen Wyatt, Country Head at JLL Vietnam, noted that Vietnam remains a promising market, with a growing trend during the past few years of manufacturing companies looking to set up operations in the country.
Industrial park developers remain confident that demand for land will continue to grow and, therefore, land prices are expected to increase, in line with the long - term potential of Vietnam's industrial segment, Wyatt said.
Companies looking to diversify their manufacturing portfolios outside China are attracted to Vietnam, thanks to its proximity to China, free trade agreements and the Government's plans to develop Vietnam into a manufacturing hub for Southeast Asia, according to JLL's latest market report.
Also, the report noted that the average price of land in northern Vietnam reached US$ 99 per square meter per lease term, up 6.5% year - on - year in the first quarter of 2020.
Meanwhile, the figure for the southern region was US$ 101, a year - on - year increase of 12.2%, compared with the fourth quarter of 2019.
In addition, ready - built factories recorded an average price of US$ 3.5 - 5 per square meter per month in both regions.
Vietnamese man cheats, sending staff to be quarantined in his stead
A businessman on the same flight from Hanoi to Hue as Vietnam's 30th Covid - 19 patient sent an employee as his substitute for quarantining.
The substitution was only discovered the next morning, Hoang Nam, Vice Chairman of Quang Tri People's Committee said Monday.
"He flew on the same flight with 'patient 30' from Hanoi to Hue," Nam said.
The unnamed man is the business head of a company that invests in a wind power project in the central province of Quang Tri.
After learning of the substitution, authorities requested the man to present himself for quarantine.
He has since been quarantined at the Tuberculosis and Lung Specialist Hospital in Dong Ha Town in the province.
At 21:30 Friday, four men checked into a hotel in Huong Hoa District, 65 kilometers west of Dong Ha Town.
They were identified as co-passengers of Vietnam's 30th Covid - 19 infection on flight VN1547 from Hanoi to Thua - Thien Hue.
The men were placed in quarantine Sunday.
Authorities only discovered there was a replacement the next morning.
Huong Hoa District authorities are tracking down people the men had come in contact with so as to place them in quarantine, too.
They will also disinfect places visited by the suspects.
The Netherlands invented a record speed wifi router
Researchers from the Eindhoven University of Technology, the Netherlands have developed successfully a new equipment that permits to transmit wifi with the speed is 300 times faster than that of the ordinary ones.
This device is expected to bring a revolution in using wifi Internet.
According to the researchers, the new wifi router operates based on the principle that in which internet data will be distributed by 'light antenna'.
The 'light antenna' mast is responsible for splitting each wavelength of the laser into separate fibers, each fiber can create infrared ray which becomes wifi internet.
Professor Ton Koonen, from the University of Science, said, the research team was studying light ray to transmit wifi internet.
Ten years ago today, on June 10, 2010, the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) ruled that Russian authorities had perpetrated a grave violation of human rights with a years - long campaign to suppress our brothers' freedom of worship.
The ECHR's judgment directed Russia to pay a sizable fine and to reinstate the registration of the Local Religious Organization of Jehovah's Witnesses in Moscow - which the authorities revoked in 2004.
Immediately after the verdict was announced, Brother Ivan Chaykovskiy, then chairman of the Moscow Community of Jehovah's Witnesses, said: This judgment is a victory of common sense over religious intolerance.
I hope that as a result of this judgment, the authorities will quickly restore our legal rights and end the nationwide state - sponsored campaign of harassment against Jehovah's Witnesses.
That optimism quickly vanished, however, as Russian authorities not only failed to abide by the terms of the ECHR ruling but also escalated their campaign of persecuting our brothers across the federation.
This persecution was dramatically expressed when Russia's Supreme Court effectively banned our peaceful worship in 2017, an injustice that has been followed by numerous arrests, trials, and imprisonments.
Although ten years old, much of the Court's stinging judgment against Russia remains relevant.
In 2010, the ECHR categorically refuted many of the baseless charges that Russia continues to level against our peaceful fellow believers today.
In summary, the ECHR concluded that the Moscow Justice Department, along with the Moscow courts, had 'no legal basis' for refusing the reregistration of Jehovah's Witnesses. The Court decried the Moscow authorities, asserting that they 'did not act in good faith and neglected their duty of neutrality and impartiality.'
Additionally, Moscow authorities were guilty of violating the European Convention on Human Rights, to which Russia is a State Party.
In 2020, as in 2010, Russia's systemic campaign against our brothers is not going unnoticed.
'For Jehovah's Witnesses in Russia, practicing their faith means risking their freedom,' said Rachel Denber, deputy Europe and Central Asia director for Human Rights Watch.
In a statement dated January 9, 2020, she added: 'There is nothing remotely justifiable about this.'
In the face of injustice, we pray in full confidence that Jehovah will continue to strengthen our brothers and sisters in Russia to 'endure fully with patience and joy.'
19 overseas returnees take Vietnam's Covid - 19 infections to 233
Vietnam confirmed six more Covid - 19 cases early Friday, five returning from abroad and one related to Hanoi's Bach Mai Hospital.
"Patient 231," 57, is an employee of the Truong Sinh Company, the food and logistics provider to Hanoi's Bach Mai Hospital, now the nation's biggest Covid - 19 hotspot.
She is a native of Bac Kan, living in the Kim Ngu Commune, Na Ri District.
On March 31, she joined a team at the Bach Mai Hospital for a business trip to the nearby Ha Nam Province.
After learning about the infection cases at Bach Mai, the Ha Nam health sector isolated members of this team.
After she tested Covid - 19 positive, she was admitted to Ha Nam General Hospital for treatment.
She takes the number of patients linked to the Bach Mai Hospital to 43, 27 of whom are employees of the Truong Sinh Company.
The other five patients are people quarantined on arrival from abroad.
Patients 228, 229 and 230 returned to Vietnam on March 20 and were quarantined in the northern province of Ninh Binh.
Further details of their flights home have not been revealed.
"Patient 228" is a 29 - year - old man from the northern province of Bac Giang now undergoing treatment at a medical center in Ninh Binh Province's Ninh Thang Commune, Hoa Lu District.
"Patient 229" and "Patient 230," women aged 30 and 28 respectively, are from the central province of Ha Tinh who have been admitted to the Ninh Binh General Hospital for treatment.
Patients "232" and "233" flew back to Vietnam March 27 on Aeroflot flight SU290 from Moscow and were quarantined in the northern province of Vinh Phuc.
They are being treated at the National Hospital for Tropical Diseases in Hanoi's Dong Anh District.
"Patient 232" is a 67 - year - old man from the southern province of Ba Ria - Vung Tau and "Patient 233" is a 24 - year - old woman from Nghe An Province in central Vietnam.
Of the 233 cases of new coronavirus infection confirmed in Vietnam until now, 75 have been discharged from hospitals.
Vietnam declared Covid - 19 a national epidemic Wednesday afternoon.
To date, the Covid - 19 pandemic has claimed almost 53,000 lives in 204 countries and territories.
No person coming from any area that has experienced a Covid - 19 outbreak will be allowed to enter Vietnam, the PM directed Tuesday.
Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc asked the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to apply the new policy to South Korea, Japan, Italy, Iran and all other countries and territories that have reported cases of Covid - 19 caused by the novel coronavirus.
Vietnam has so far achieved positive results in fighting the Covid - 19, but the epidemic has entered its next stage, spreading to many other parts of the world and is now developing complicatedly and unpredictably in South Korea, Japan, Italy and Iran, the PM noted.
For those who have to enter Vietnam for state affairs or exclusive matters, the government requests them to follow the nation's health declaration procedure and stay in quarantine for 14 days.
Citizens of countries stricken by Covid - 19, but from cities / provinces free of the epidemic, will have to submit a health declaration and submit to further procedures deemed necessary when entering Vietnam.
Vietnamese citizens from China's epidemic hit areas can return home, but only via international border gates and will have to be quarantined for two weeks on entry, continuing the policy being followed for the past month.
For its part, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has called on all Vietnamese citizens not to travel to affected areas and if such travel is unavoidable, they have to be quarantined on return.
Vietnamese expatriates in epidemic - hit areas have been told to strictly follow regulations and guidance of the local authorities; and advised not to return to Vietnam at this time.
Deputy PM Vu Duc Dam had said earlier Tuesday that in order for the country to achieve the positive results it has so far, Vietnam had been proactively implementing measures to prevent and limit the epidemic from mid-December last year, as soon as reports appeared of the Covid - 19 in China's Wuhan City.
Staring February 1, Vietnam had suspended all flights to and from China and stopped granting tourist visas to Chinese from epidemic - stricken areas.
After South Korea raised its disease alert to the 'highest level,' the Vietnamese government has tightened controls for visitors from that country.
Starting Monday, everyone coming in from South Korea has to make health declarations, and those with symptoms like high fever, coughing and breathing difficulties will be placed in quarantine for a minimum of 14 days.
Now all flights from infected areas in South Korea will be diverted to smaller airports – Van Don in the northern Quang Ninh Province, Phu Cat in the south central Binh Dinh Province and Can Tho in the Mekong Delta.
Saigon and Da Nang are currently quarantining 83 people coming on Monday from South Korea's Daegu City, where a major coronavirus outbreak has been detected.
Some South Koreans who refused to be quarantined has flown home late Tuesday night.
South Korea is making headlines internationally as one of the worst - hit countries and territories by the coronavirus epidemic, recording 977 infections by Tuesday evening, second only to China.
As of Tuesday, the last of the 16 infection novel coronavirus infections detected so far in Vietnam had fully recovered.
Over the past 13 days, no new infection case has been reported in the country.
The Covid - 19 is affecting 39 countries and territories.
Death toll has crossed 2,700, mostly in China, followed by Iran with 15, South Korea with 11 and Italy with seven.
Floods kill runner of Dalat Ultra Trail 2020
A runner of the Ultra Trail 2020 international marathon, which is taking place in the Central Highlands city of Dalat, was found dead this afternoon, June 20 after he was swept away by floodwaters triggered by downpours.
The victim, identified as Thai Don Thanh, was running across a section of the Golden Stream in Lac Duong District's Da Sal Commune when the 40 - year - old resident of HCMC met with the accident, Sai Gon Giai Phong news site reported.
The government of Lac Duong District told Tuoi Tre Online that due to the heavy rain on the same day, floodwater levels rose sharply, while the runners were competing in the rain.
After the accident had occurred, the organizers of the marathon suspended the competition and used vehicles to transport runners back to the starting point.
Over 6,200 local and foreign runners are joining the Dalat Ultra Trail 2020.
Japan is now testing a robot cooking soba noodles at Tokyo station
It is JR East startup Co., Ltd., that has run an experiment on a robot cooking soba noodles for train passengers at Tokyo station recently.
The robot, put at Higashi - Koganei Station on Railway Co. 's Chuo Line, is capable of making 40 soba dishes an hour, about the same as a cook's performance.
The robot takes charge of boiling the noodles while the staffs take charge of putting them on a plate and giving them to the customer.
Based on the information from the East Japan Railway Company, the trial period might be extended to April 15 with the aim to determine whether the robot can work well enough and satisfy the expectations of its noodle - loving customers or not.
According to a staff, by virtue of the robot, it is possible to beat the kitchen heat in the summer as well as the risk of burning from scalding noodle water.
Besides, while the robot boils up noodles, the chef is given an opportunity to have time to do something else, such as dealing with customers, cooking fried food and clearing away dishes.

So how does it store so much information in such a small space?
At the heart of every hard drive is a stack of high - speed spinning discs with a recording head flying over each surface.
Each disc is coated with a film of microscopic magnetised metal grains, and your data does n't live there in a form you can recognize.
Instead, it is recorded as a magnetic pattern formed by groups of those tiny grains.
In each group, also known as a bit, all of the grains have their magnetization's aligned in one of two possible states, which correspond to zeroes and ones.
Data is written onto the disc by converting strings of bits into electrical current fed through an electromagnet.
This magnet generates a field strong enough to change the direction of the metal grain's magnetization.
Once this information is written onto the disc, the drive uses a magnetic reader to turn it back into a useful form, much like a phonograph needle translates a record's grooves into music.
But how can you get so much information out of just zeroes and ones?
Well, by putting lots of them together.
For example, a letter is represented in one byte, or eight bits, and your average photo takes up several megabytes, each of which is 8 million bits.
Because each bit must be written onto a physical area of the disc, we're always seeking to increase the disc's areal density, or how many bits can be squeezed into one square inch.
The area density of a modern hard drive is about 600 gigabits per square inch, 300 million times greater than that of IBM's first hard drive from 1957.
This amazing advance in storage capacity was n't just a matter of making everything smaller, but involved multiple innovations.
A technique called the thin film lithography process allowed engineers to shrink the reader and writer.
And despite its size, the reader became more sensitive by taking advantage of new discoveries in magnetic and quantum properties of matter.
Bits could also be packed closer together thanks to mathematical algorithms that filter out noise from magnetic interference, and find the most likely bit sequences from each chunk of read - back signal.
And thermal expansion control of the head, enabled by placing a heater under the magnetic writer, allowed it to fly less than five nanometers above the disc's surface, about the width of two strands of DNA.
For the past several decades, the exponential growth in computer storage capacity and processing power has followed a pattern known as Moore's Law, which, in 1975, predicted that information density would double every two years.
But at around 100 gigabits per square inch, shrinking the magnetic grains further or cramming them closer together posed a new risk called the superparamagnetic effect.
When a magnetic grain volume is too small, its magnetization is easily disturbed by heat energy and can cause bits to switch unintentionally, leading to data loss.
Scientists resolved this limitation in a remarkably simple way: by changing the direction of recording from longitudinal to perpendicular, allowing areal density to approach one terabit per square inch.
Recently, the potential limit has been increased yet again through heat assisted magnetic recording.
This uses an even more thermally stable recording medium, whose magnetic resistance is momentarily reduced by heating up a particular spot with a laser and allowing data to be written.
And while those drives are currently in the prototype stage, scientists already have the next potential trick up their sleeves: bit-patterned media, where bit locations are arranged in separate, nano - sized structures, potentially allowing for areal densities of twenty terabits per square inch or more.
So it's thanks to the combined efforts of generations of engineers, material scientists, and quantum physicists that this tool of incredible power and precision can spin in the palm of your hand.
Little do they know it, but these six creatures are each about to experience a very unusual death.
a carnivorous plant.
Around the world there are more than 600 plant species that supplement a regular diet of sunlight, water, and soil with insects, microbes, or even frogs and rats.
Scientists believe that carnivory in plants evolved separately at least six times on our planet, suggesting that this flesh - munching adaptation holds a major benefit for plants.
Carnivorous plants tend to grow in places with highly acidic soil, which is poor in crucial nutrients like nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium.
In these hostile conditions, plants that are able to lure, trap, and digest prey have an advantage over those that rely on soil for their nutrients.
Take this inhospitable bog, where pitcher plants reign supreme.
Drawn to the pitcher's vivid colors and alluring scent, the fly closes in and slurps its nectar.
But this pitcher species has an ingredient called coniine in its nectar, a powerful narcotic to insects.
As the coniine takes effect, the fly grows sluggish, stumbles, and falls down the funnel into a pool of liquid at the base, where he drowns.
Enzymes and bacteria in the liquid slowly break his body down into microscopic particles the pitcher plant can consume through its leaves.
Occasionally, larger prey also tumbles into the fatal funnel of the pitcher plant.
The second victim faces off with the sticky sundew plant.
The sundew's tiny leaves are equipped with a viscous secretion called mucilage.
The ant is swiftly trapped in this goo.
As she struggles, enzymes begin to digest her body.
Special tentacles sense her movement and curl around her, clenching her in their suffocating grip.
Once she asphyxiates, which can happen in under an hour, the tentacles unfurl again to snare their next victim.
Two down, four to go.
The next target meets his end underground, in the coils of the corkscrew plant.
He enters the roots through a tiny slit in search of food.
But inside, he quickly loses his way through the tangled labyrinth.
A forest of curved hairs prevents his escape, guiding him into a central chamber with flesh - digesting enzymes and deadly low levels of oxygen.
In the murky depths of a nearby pond, a tadpole unwittingly swims into the path of the bladderwort, the speediest of all carnivorous plants.
She treads on the bladderwort's trigger, and in milliseconds, a trapdoor swings open and sucks her in.
Trapped half in and half out, she struggles to free herself while the part of her body inside the plant gets digested.
Over the next few hours, her writhing sets the trap off repeatedly, each time bringing her deeper into the plant to be digested alive bit by bit.
Meanwhile, this beetle is bewitched by sweet - smelling nectar.
The scent draws him closer and closer until he lands on the leaves of the world's most infamous carnivorous plant.
His landing triggers tiny hairs on the surface of the leaves, and the jaws of the venus fly trap snap shut around him.
The spikes interlock to seal his fate.
Once closed, the leaves act like an external stomach that digests the beetle's soft tissues.
When they open again a few days later, only the dry husk of his exoskeleton remains.
The mayfly is the last creature standing.
As she approaches the butterwort plant, she heads for the flowers that wave high above the plant's globs of adhesive goo.
She alights on the petals, drinks the nectar, and takes off unscathed.
These long flower stalks keep certain insects away from the carnivore's traps - a way of separating pollinators from food.
Off the mayfly buzzes to live a long and fruitful life – oh.
So in my free time outside of Twitter I experiment a little bit with telling stories online, experimenting with what we can do with new digital tools.
And in my job at Twitter, I actually spent a little bit of time working with authors and storytellers as well, helping to expand out the bounds of what people are experimenting with.
And I want to talk through some examples today of things that people have done that I think are really fascinating using flexible identity and anonymity on the web and blurring the lines between fact and fiction.
But I want to start and go back to the 1930s.
Long before a little thing called Twitter, radio brought us broadcasts and connected millions of people to single points of broadcast.
And from those single points emanated stories.
Some of them were familiar stories.
Some of them were new stories.
And for a while they were familiar formats, but then radio began to evolve its own unique formats specific to that medium.
Think about episodes that happened live on radio.
Combining the live play and the serialization of written fiction, you get this new format.
And the reason why I bring up radio is that I think radio is a great example of how a new medium defines new formats which then define new stories.
And of course, today, we have an entirely new medium to play with, which is this online world.
This is the map of verified users on Twitter and the connections between them.
There are thousands upon thousands of them.
Every single one of these points is its own broadcaster.
We've gone to this world of many to many, where access to the tools is the only barrier to broadcasting.
And I think that we should start to see wildly new formats emerge as people learn how to tell stories in this new medium.
I actually believe that we are in a wide open frontier for creative experimentation, if you will, that we've explored and begun to settle this wild land of the Internet and are now just getting ready to start to build structures on it, and those structures are the new formats of storytelling that the Internet will allow us to create.
I believe this starts with an evolution of existing methods.
The short story, for example, people are saying that the short story is experiencing a renaissance of sorts thanks to e-readers, digital marketplaces.
One writer, Hugh Howey, experimented with short stories on Amazon by releasing one very short story called "Wool."
And he actually says that he did n't intend for "Wool" to become a series, but that the audience loved the first story so much they demanded more, and so he gave them more.
He gave them "Wool 2," which was a little bit longer than the first one, "Wool 3," which was even longer, culminating in "Wool 5," which was a 60,000 - word novel.
I think Howey was able to do all of this because he had the quick feedback system of e - books.
He was able to write and publish in relatively short order.
There was no mediator between him and the audience.
It was just him directly connected with his audience and building on the feedback and enthusiasm that they were giving him.
So this whole project was an experiment.
It started with the one short story, and I think the experimentation actually became a part of Howey's format.
And that's something that this medium enabled, was experimentation being a part of the format itself.
This is a short story by the author Jennifer Egan called "Black Box."
It was originally written specifically with Twitter in mind.
Egan convinced The New Yorker to start a New Yorker fiction account from which they could tweet all of these lines that she created.
Now Twitter, of course, has a 140 - character limit.
Egan mocked that up just writing manually in this storyboard sketchbook, used the physical space constraints of those storyboard squares to write each individual tweet, and those tweets ended up becoming over 600 of them that were serialized by The New Yorker.
Every night, at 8 p. m, you could tune in to a short story from The New Yorker's fiction account.
I think that's pretty exciting: tune - in literary fiction.
The experience of Egan's story, of course, like anything on Twitter, there were multiple ways to experience it.
You could scroll back through it, but interestingly, if you were watching it live, there was this suspense that built because the actual tweets, you had no control over when you would read them.
They were coming at a pretty regular clip, but as the story was building, normally, as a reader, you control how fast you move through a text, but in this case, The New Yorker did, and they were sending you bit by bit by bit, and you had this suspense of waiting for the next line.
Another great example of fiction and the short story on Twitter, Elliott Holt is an author who wrote a story called "Evidence."
It began with this tweet: "On November 28 at 10:13 p.m., a woman identified as Miranda Brown, 44, of Brooklyn, fell to her death from the roof of a Manhattan hotel."
It begins in Elliott's voice, but then Elliott's voice recedes, and we hear the voices of Elsa, Margot and Simon, characters that Elliott created on Twitter specifically to tell this story, a story from multiple perspectives leading up to this moment at 10:13 p. m.
when this woman falls to her death.
These three characters brought an authentic vision from multiple perspectives.
One reviewer called Elliott's story "Twitter fiction done right," because she did.
She captured that voice and she had multiple characters and it happened in real time.
Interestingly, though, it was n't just Twitter as a distribution mechanism.
It was also Twitter as a production mechanism.
Elliott told me later she wrote the whole thing with her thumbs.
She laid on the couch and just went back and forth between different characters tweeting out each line, line by line.
I think that this kind of spontaneous creation of what was coming out of the characters' voices really lent an authenticity to the characters themselves, but also to this format that she had created of multiple perspectives in a single story on Twitter.
As you begin to play with flexible identity online, it gets even more interesting as you start to interact with the real world.
Things like Invisible Obama or the famous "binders full of women" that came up during the 2012 election cycle, or even the fan fiction universe of "West Wing" Twitter in which you have all of these accounts for every single one of the characters in "The West Wing," including the bird that taps at Josh Lyman's window in one single episode.
(Laughter) All of these are rapid iterations on a theme.
They are creative people experimenting with the bounds of what is possible in this medium.
You look at something like "West Wing" Twitter, in which you have these fictional characters that engage with the real world.
They comment on politics, they cry out against the evils of Congress.
Keep in mind, they're all Democrats.
And they engage with the real world.
They respond to it.
So once you take flexible identity, anonymity, engagement with the real world, and you move beyond simple homage or parody and you put these tools to work in telling a story, that's when things get really interesting.
So during the Chicago mayoral election there was a parody account.
It was Mayor Emanuel.
It gave you everything you wanted from Rahm Emanuel, particularly in the expletive department.
This foul - mouthed account followed the daily activities of the race, providing commentary as it went.
It followed all of the natural tropes of a good, solid Twitter parody account, but then started to get weird.
And as it progressed, it moved from this commentary to a multi-week, real - time science fiction epic in which your protagonist, Rahm Emanuel, engages in multi-dimensional travel on election day, which is -- it did n't actually happen.
I double checked the newspapers.
And then, very interestingly, it came to an end.
This is something that does n't usually happen with a Twitter parody account.
It ended, a true narrative conclusion.
And so the author, Dan Sinker, who was a journalist, who was completely anonymous this whole time, I think Dan -- it made a lot of sense for him to turn this into a book, because it was a narrative format in the end, and I think that turning it into a book is representative of this idea that he had created something new that needed to be translated into previous formats.
One of my favorite examples of something that's happening on Twitter right now, actually, is the very absurdist Crimer Show.
Crimer Show tells the story of a supercriminal and a hapless detective that face off in this exceptionally strange lingo, with all of the tropes of a television show.
Crimer Show's creator has said that it is a parody of a popular type of show in the U.K., but, man, is it weird.
And there are all these times where Crimer, the supercriminal, does all of these TV things.
He's always taking off his sunglasses or turning to the camera, but these things just happen in text.
I think borrowing all of these tropes from television and additionally presenting each Crimer Show as an episode, spelled E - P - P - A - S - O - D, "eppasod," presenting them as episodes really, it creates something new.
There is a new "eppasod" of Crimer Show on Twitter pretty much every day, and they're archived that way.
And I think this is an interesting experiment in format.
Something totally new has been created here out of parodying something on television.
I think in nonfiction real - time storytelling, there are a lot of really excellent examples as well.
RealTimeWWII is an account that documents what was happening on this day 60 years ago in exceptional detail, as if you were reading the news reports from that day.
And the author Teju Cole has done a lot of experimentation with putting a literary twist on events of the news.
In this particular case, he's talking about drone strikes.
I think that in both of these examples, you're beginning to see ways in which people are telling stories with nonfiction content that can be built into new types of fictional storytelling.
So with real - time storytelling, blurring the lines between fact and fiction, the real world and the digital world, flexible identity, anonymity, these are all tools that we have accessible to us, and I think that they're just the building blocks.
They are the bits that we use to create the structures, the frames, that then become our settlements on this wide open frontier for creative experimentation.
You're lifting weights.
The first time feels easy, but each lift takes more and more effort until you ca n't continue.
Inside your arms, the muscles responsible for the lifting have become unable to contract.
Why do our muscles get fatigued?
We often blame lactic acid or running out of energy, but these factors alone do n't account for muscle fatigue.
There's another major contributor: the muscle's ability to respond to signals from the brain.
To understand the roots of muscle fatigue, it helps to know how a muscle contracts in response to a signal from a nerve.
These signals travel from the brain to the muscles in a fraction of a second via long, thin cells called motor neurons.
The motor neuron and the muscle cell are separated by a tiny gap, and the exchange of particles across this gap enables the contraction.
On one side of the gap, the motor neuron contains a neurotransmitter called acetylcholine.
On the other side, charged particles, or ions, line the muscle cell's membrane: potassium on the inside, and sodium on the outside.
In response to a signal from the brain, the motor neuron releases acetylcholine, which triggers pores on the muscle cell membrane to open.
Sodium flows in, and potassium flows out.
The flux of these charged particles is a crucial step for muscle contraction: the change in charge creates an electrical signal called an action potential that spreads through the muscle cell, stimulating the release of calcium that's stored inside it.
This flood of calcium causes the muscle to contract by enabling proteins buried in the muscle fibers to lock together and ratchet towards each other, pulling the muscle tight.
The energy used to power the contraction comes from a molecule called ATP.
ATP also helps pump the ions back across the membrane afterward, resetting the balance of sodium and potassium on either side.
This whole process repeats every time a muscle contracts.
With each contraction, energy in the form of ATP gets used up, waste products like lactic acid are generated, and some ions drift away from the muscle's cell membrane, leaving a smaller and smaller group behind.
Though muscle cells use up ATP as they contract repeatedly, they are always making more, so most of the time even heavily fatigued muscles still have not depleted this energy source.
And though many waste products are acidic, fatigued muscles still maintain p H within normal limits, indicating that the tissue is effectively clearing these wastes.
But eventually, over the course of repeated contractions there may not be sufficient concentrations of potassium, sodium or calcium ions immediately available near the muscle cell membrane to reset the system properly.
So even if the brain sends a signal, the muscle cell ca n't generate the action potential necessary to contract.
Even when ions like sodium, potassium or calcium are depleted in or around the muscle cell, these ions are plentiful elsewhere in the body.
With a little time, they will flow back to the areas where they're needed, sometimes with the help of active sodium and potassium pumps.
So if you pause and rest, muscle fatigue will subside as these ions replenish throughout the muscle.
That's because the stronger you are, the fewer times this cycle of nerve signal from the brain to contraction in the muscle has to be repeated to lift a certain amount of weight.
Fewer cycles means slower ion depletion, so as your physical fitness improves, you can exercise for longer at the same intensity.
Many muscles grow with exercise, and larger muscles also have bigger stores of ATP and a higher capacity to clear waste, pushing fatigue even farther into the future.
Economists have been exploring people's behavior for hundreds of years: how we make decisions, how we act individually and in groups, how we exchange value.
They've studied the institutions that facilitate our trade, like legal systems, corporations, marketplaces.
But there is a new, technological institution that will fundamentally change how we exchange value, and it's called the blockchain.
Now, that's a pretty bold statement, but if you take nothing else away from this talk, I actually want you to remember that while blockchain technology is relatively new, it's also a continuation of a very human story, and the story is this.
As humans, we find ways to lower uncertainty about one another so that we can exchange value.
Now, one of the first people to really explore the idea of institutions as a tool in economics to lower our uncertainties about one another and be able to do trade was the Nobel economist Douglass North.
He passed away at the end of 2015, but North pioneered what's called "new institutional economics."
And what he meant by institutions were really just formal rules like a constitution, and informal constraints, like bribery.
These institutions are really the grease that allow our economic wheels to function, and we can see this play out over the course of human history.
If we think back to when we were hunter - gatherer economies, we really just traded within our village structure.
We had some informal constraints in place, but we enforced all of our trade with violence or social repercussions.
As our societies grew more complex and our trade routes grew more distant, we built up more formal institutions, institutions like banks for currency, governments, corporations.
These institutions helped us manage our trade as the uncertainty and the complexity grew, and our personal control was much lower.
Eventually with the internet, we put these same institutions online.
We built platform marketplaces like Amazon, eBay, Alibaba, just faster institutions that act as middlemen to facilitate human economic activity.
As Douglass North saw it, institutions are a tool to lower uncertainty so that we can connect and exchange all kinds of value in society.
And I believe we are now entering a further and radical evolution of how we interact and trade, because for the first time, we can lower uncertainty not just with political and economic institutions, like our banks, our corporations, our governments, but we can do it with technology alone.
So what is the blockchain?
Blockchain technology is a decentralized database that stores a registry of assets and transactions across a peer - to - peer network.
It's basically a public registry of who owns what and who transacts what.
The transactions are secured through cryptography, and over time, that transaction history gets locked in blocks of data that are then cryptographically linked together and secured.
This creates an immutable, unforgeable record of all of the transactions across this network.
This record is replicated on every computer that uses the network.
It's not an app.
It's not a company.
I think it's closest in description to something like Wikipedia.
We can see everything on Wikipedia.
It's a composite view that's constantly changing and being updated.
We can also track those changes over time on Wikipedia, and we can create our own wikis, because at their core, they're just a data infrastructure.
On Wikipedia, it's an open platform that stores words and images and the changes to that data over time.
On the blockchain, you can think of it as an open infrastructure that stores many kinds of assets.
It stores the history of custodianship, ownership and location for assets like the digital currency Bitcoin, other digital assets like a title of ownership of IP.
It could be a certificate, a contract, real world objects, even personal identifiable information.
There are of course other technical details to the blockchain, but at it s core, that's how it works.
It's this public registry that stores transactions in a network and is replicated so that it's very secure and hard to tamper with.
Which brings me to my point of how blockchains lower uncertainty and how they therefore promise to transform our economic systems in radical ways.
So uncertainty is kind of a big term in economics, but I want to go through three forms of it that we face in almost all of our everyday transactions, where blockchains can play a role.
We face uncertainties like not knowing who we're dealing with, not having visibility into a transaction and not having recourse if things go wrong.
So let's take the first example, not knowing who we're dealing with.
Say I want to buy a used smartphone on eBay.
The first thing I'm going to do is look up who I'm buying from.
Are they a power user?
Do they have great reviews and ratings, or do they have no profile at all?
Reviews, ratings, checkmarks: these are the attestations about our identities that we cobble together today and use to lower uncertainty about who we're dealing with.
But the problem is they're very fragmented.
Think about how many profiles you have.
Blockchains allow for us to create an open, global platform on which to store any attestation about any individual from any source.
This allows us to create a user - controlled portable identity.
More than a profile, it means you can selectively reveal the different attributes about you that help facilitate trade or interaction, for instance that a government issued you an ID, or that you're over 21, by revealing the cryptographic proof that these details exist and are signed off on.
Having this kind of portable identity around the physical world and the digital world means we can do all kinds of human trade in a totally new way.
So I've talked about how blockchains could lower uncertainty in who we're dealing with.
The second uncertainty that we often face is just not having transparency into our interactions.
Say you're going to send me that smartphone by mail.
I want some degree of transparency.
I want to know that the product I bought is the same one that arrives in the mail and that there's some record for how it got to me.
This is true not just for electronics like smartphones, but for many kinds of goods and data, things like medicine, luxury goods, any kind of data or product that we do n't want tampered with.
The problem in many companies, especially those that produce something complicated like a smartphone, is they're managing all of these different vendors across a horizontal supply chain.
All of these people that go into making a product, they do n't have the same database.
They do n't use the same infrastructure, and so it becomes really hard to see transparently a product evolve over time.
Using the blockchain, we can create a shared reality across nontrusting entities.
By this I mean all of these nodes in the network do not need to know each other or trust each other, because they each have the ability to monitor and validate the chain for themselves.
Think back to Wikipedia.
It's a shared database, and even though it has multiple readers and multiple writers at the same time, it has one single truth.
So we can create that using blockchains.
We can create a decentralized database that has the same efficiency of a monopoly without actually creating that central authority.
So all of these vendors, all sorts of companies, can interact using the same database without trusting one another.
It means for consumers, we can have a lot more transparency.
As a real - world object travels along, we can see its digital certificate or token move on the blockchain, adding value as it goes.
This is a whole new world in terms of our visibility.
So I've talked about how blockchains can lower our uncertainties about identity and how they change what we mean about transparency in long distances and complex trades, like in a supply chain.
The last uncertainty that we often face is one of the most open - ended, and it's reneging.
What if you do n't send me the smartphone?
Can I get my money back?
Blockchains allow us to write code, binding contracts, between individuals and then guarantee that those contracts will bear out without a third party enforcer.
So if we look at the smartphone example, you could think about escrow.
You are financing that phone, but you do n't need to release the funds until you can verify that all the conditions have been met.
You got the phone.
I think this is one of the most exciting ways that blockchains lower our uncertainties, because it means to some degree we can collapse institutions and their enforcement.
It means a lot of human economic activity can get collateralized and automated, and push a lot of human intervention to the edges, the places where information moves from the real world to the blockchain.
I think what would probably floor Douglass North about this use of technology is the fact that the very thing that makes it work, the very thing that keeps the blockchain secure and verified, is our mutual distrust.
So rather than all of our uncertainties slowing us down and requiring institutions like banks, our governments, our corporations, we can actually harness all of that collective uncertainty and use it to collaborate and exchange more and faster and more open.
Now, I do n't want you to get the impression that the blockchain is the solution to everything, even though the media has said that it's going to end world poverty, it's also going to solve the counterfeit drug problem and potentially save the rainforest.
The truth is, this technology is in its infancy, and we're going to need to see a lot of experiments take place and probably fail before we truly understand all of the use cases for our economy.
But there are tons of people working on this, from financial institutions to technology companies, start - ups and universities.
And one of the reasons is that it's not just an economic evolution.
It's also an innovation in computer science.
Blockchains give us the technological capability of creating a record of human exchange, of exchange of currency, of all kinds of digital and physical assets, even of our own personal attributes, in a totally new way.
So in some ways, they become a technological institution that has a lot of the benefits of the traditional institutions we're used to using in society, but it does this in a decentralized way.
It does this by converting a lot of our uncertainties into certainties.
So I think we need to start preparing ourselves, because we are about to face a world where distributed, autonomous institutions have quite a significant role.
(Applause) Bruno Giussani: Thank you, Bettina.
I think I understood that it's coming, it offers a lot of potential, and it's complex.
What is your estimate for the rate of adoption?
Bettina Warburg: I think that's a really good question.
My lab is pretty much focused on going the enterprise and government route first, because in reality, blockchain is a complex technology.
How many of you actually understand how the internet works?
But you use it every day, so I think we're sort of facing the same John Sculley idea of technology should either be invisible or beautiful, and blockchain is kind of neither of those things right now, so it's better suited for either really early adopters who kind of get it and can tinker around or for finding those best use cases like identity or asset tracking or smart contracts that can be used at that level of an enterprise or government.
BG: Thank you.
Thanks for coming to TED.
BW: Thanks.
(Music) (Applause) (Music) (Applause)
What do these animals have in common?
More than you might think.
Along with over 5,000 other species, they're mammals, or members of class mammalia.
All mammals are vertebrates, meaning they have backbones.
But mammals are distinguished from other vertebrates by a number of shared features.
That includes warm blood, body hair or fur, the ability to breathe using lungs, and nourishing their young with milk.
But despite these similarities, these creatures also have many biological differences, and one of the most remarkable is how they give birth.
Let's start with the most familiar, placental mammals.
This group includes humans, cats, dogs, giraffes, and even the blue whale, the biggest animal on Earth.
Its placenta, a solid disk of blood - rich tissue, attaches to the wall of the uterus to support the developing embryo.
Directly connected to the mother's blood supply, it funnels nutrients and oxygen straight into the calf's body via the umbilical cord, and also exports its waste.
Placental mammals can spend far longer inside the womb than other mammals.
Baby blue whales, for instance, spend almost a full year inside their mother.
The placenta keeps the calf alive right up until its birth, when the umbilical cord breaks and the newborn's own respiratory, circulatory, and waste disposal systems take over.
Measuring about 23 feet, a newborn calf is already able to swim.
It will spend the next six months drinking 225 liters of its mothers thick, fatty milk per day.
Meanwhile, in Australia, you can find a second type of mammal - marsupials.
Marsupial babies are so tiny and delicate when they're born that they must continue developing in the mother's pouch.
Take the quoll, one of the world's smallest marsupials, which weighs only 18 milligrams at birth, the equivalent of about 30 sugar grains.
The kangaroo, another marsupial, gives birth to a single jelly bean - sized baby at a time.
The baby crawls down the middle of the mother's three vaginas, then must climb up to the pouch, where she spends the next 6 - 11 months suckling.
Even after the baby kangaroo leaves this warm haven, she'll return to suckle milk.
Sometimes, she's just one of three babies her mother is caring for.
A female kangaroo can often simultaneously support one inside her uterus and another in her pouch.
When that happens, she's able to produce two different kinds of milk, one for her newborn, and one for her older joey.
The word mammalia means of the breast, which is a bit of a misnomer because while kangaroos do produce milk from nipples in their pouches, they do n't actually have breasts.
Nor do monotremes, the third and arguably strangest example of mammalian birth.
There were once hundreds of monotreme species, but there are only five left: four species of echidnas and the duck - billed platypus.
The name monotreme means one hole referring to the single orifice they use for reproduction, excretion, and egg - laying.
Like birds, reptiles, fish, dinosaurs, and others, these species lay eggs instead of giving birth to live young.
Their eggs are soft - shelled, and when their babies hatch, they suckle milk from pores on their mother's body until they're large enough to feed themselves.
Despite laying eggs and other adaptations that we associate more with non-mammals, like the duck - bill platypus's webbed feet, bill, and the venomous spur males have on their feet, they are, in fact, mammals.
That's because they share the defining characteristics of mammalia and are evolutionarily linked to the rest of the class.
Whether placental, marsupial, or monotreme, each of these creatures and its unique birthing methods, however bizarre, have succeeded for many millennia in bringing new life and diversity into the mammal kingdom.
Professor Fukanō, the famous eccentric scientist and adventurer, has embarked on a new challenge: flying around the world nonstop in a plane of his own design.
Able to travel consistently at the incredible speed of one degree longitude around the equator per minute, the plane would take six hours to circle the world.
There's just one problem: the plane can only hold 180 kiloliters of fuel, only enough for exactly half the journey.
Let's be honest.
The professor probably could have designed the plane to hold more fuel, but where's the fun in that?
Instead, he's devised a slightly more elaborate solution: building three identical planes for the mission.
In addition to their speed, the professor's equipped them with a few other incredible features.
Each of the planes can turn on a dime and instantly transfer any amount of its fuel to any of the others in midair without slowing down, provided they're next to each other.
The professor will pilot the first plane, while his two assistants Fugōri and Orokana will pilot each of the others.
However, only one airport, located on the equator, has granted permission for the experiment, making it the starting point, the finish line, and the only spot where the planes can land, takeoff, or refuel on the ground.
How should the three planes coordinate so the professor can fly continuously for the whole trip and achieve his dream without anyone running out of fuel and crashing?
Pause here if you want to figure it out for yourself.
Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 According to the professor's calculations, they should be able to pull it off by a hair.
The key is to maximize the support each assistant provides, not wasting a single kiloliter of fuel.
It also helps us to think symmetrically so they can make shorter trips in either direction while setting the professor up for a long unsupported stretch in the middle.
Here's his solution.
All three planes take off at noon flying west, each fully loaded with 180 kiloliters.
After 45 minutes, or one - eighth of the way around, each plane has 135 kiloliters left.
Orokana gives 45 to the professor and 45 to Fugōri, fully refueling them both.
With her remaining 45, Orokana returns to the airport and heads to the lounge for a well - deserved break.
45 minutes later, with one - quarter of the trip complete, the professor and Fugōri are both at 135 kiloliters again.
Fugōri transfers 45 into the professor's tank, leaving himself with the 90 he needs to return.
Professor Fukanō stretches and puts on his favorite album.
He'll be alone for a while.
In the meantime, Orokana has been anxiously awaiting Fugōri's return, her plane fully refueled and ready to go.
As soon as his plane touches the ground, she takes off, this time flying east.
At this point, exactly 180 minutes have passed and the professor is at the halfway point of his journey with 90 kiloliters of fuel left.
For the next 90 minutes, the professor and Orokana's planes fly towards each other, meeting at the three - quarter mark.
Just as the professor's fuel is about the run out, he sees Orokana's plane.
She gives him 45 kiloliters of her remaining 90, leaving them with 45 each.
But that's just half of what they need to make it to the airport.
Fortunately, this is exactly when Fugōri, having refueled, takes off.
45 minutes later, just as the other two planes are about to run empty, he meets them at the 315 degree point and transfers 45 kiloliters of fuel to each, leaving 45 for himself.
All three planes land at the airport just as their fuel gauges reach zero.
As the reporters and photographers cheer, the professor promises his planes will soon be available for commercial flights, just as soon as they figure out how to keep their inflight meals from spilling everywhere.
I, like many of you, am one of the two billion people on Earth who live in cities.
And there are days -- I do n't know about the rest of you -- but there are days when I palpably feel how much I rely on other people for pretty much everything in my life.
And some days, that can even be a little scary.
But what I'm here to talk to you about today is how that same interdependence is actually an extremely powerful social infrastructure that we can actually harness to help heal some of our deepest civic issues, if we apply open - source collaboration.
A couple of years ago, I read an article by New York Times writer Michael Pollan, in which he argued that growing even some of our own food is one of the best things that we can do for the environment.
Now at the time that I was reading this, it was the middle of the winter and I definitely did not have room for a lot of dirt in my New York City apartment.
So I was basically just willing to settle for just reading the next Wired magazine and finding out how the experts were going to figure out how to solve all these problems for us in the future.
But that was actually exactly the point that Michael Pollan was making in this article -- it's precisely when we hand over the responsibility for all these things to specialists that we cause the kind of messes that we see with the food system.
So, I happen to know a little bit from my own work about how NASA has been using hydroponics to explore growing food in space.
And that you can actually get optimal nutritional yield by running a kind of high - quality liquid soil over plants' root systems.
Now to a vegetable plant, my apartment has got to be about as foreign as outer space.
But I can offer some natural light and year - round climate control.
Fast - forward two years later: we now have window farms, which are vertical, hydroponic platforms for food - growing indoors.
And the way it works is that there's a pump at the bottom, which periodically sends this liquid nutrient solution up to the top, which then trickles down through plants' root systems that are suspended in clay pellets -- so there's no dirt involved.
Now light and temperature vary with each window's microclimate, so a window farm requires a farmer, and she must decide what kind of crops she is going to put in her window farm, and whether she is going to feed her food organically.
Back at the time, a window farm was no more than a technically complex idea that was going to require a lot of testing.
And I really wanted it to be an open project, because hydroponics is one of the fastest growing areas of patenting in the United States right now, and could possibly become another area like Monsanto, where we have a lot of corporate intellectual property in the way of people's food.
So I decided that, instead of creating a product, what I was going to do was open this up to a whole bunch of codevelopers.
The first few systems that we created, they kind of worked.
We were actually able to grow about a salad a week in a typical New York City apartment window.
And we were able to grow cherry tomatoes and cucumbers, all kinds of stuff.
But the first few systems were these leaky, loud power - guzzlers that Martha Stewart would definitely never have approved.
(Laughter) So to bring on more codevelopers, what we did was we created a social media site on which we published the designs, we explained how they worked, and we even went so far as to point out everything that was wrong with these systems.
And then we invited people all over the world to build them and experiment with us.
So actually now on this website, we have 18,000 people.
And we have window farms all over the world.
What we're doing is what NASA or a large corporation would call R &D, or research and development.
But what we call it is R&D - I - Y, or "research and develop it yourself."
(Laughter) So, for example, Jackson came along and suggested that we use air pumps instead of water pumps.
It took building a whole bunch of systems to get it right, but once we did, we were able to cut our carbon footprint nearly in half.
Tony in Chicago has been taking on growing experiments, like lots of other window farmers, and he's been able to get his strawberries to fruit for nine months of the year in low - light conditions by simply changing out the organic nutrients.
And window farmers in Finland have been customizing their window farms for the dark days of the Finnish winters by outfitting them with LED grow lights that they're now making open source and part of the project.
So window farms have been evolving through a rapid versioning process similar to software.
And with every open source project, the real benefit is the interplay between the specific concerns of people customizing their systems for their own particular concerns, and the universal concerns.
So my core team and I are able to concentrate on the improvements that really benefit everyone.
And we're able to look out for the needs of newcomers.
So for do - it - yourselfers, we provide free, very well - tested instructions so that anyone, anywhere around the world, can build one of these systems for free.
And there's a patent pending on these systems as well that's held by the community.
And to fund the project, we partner to create products that we then sell to schools and to individuals who do n't have time to build their own systems.
Now within our community, a certain culture has appeared.
In our culture, it is better to be a tester who supports someone else's idea than it is to be just the idea guy.
What we get out of this project is support for our own work, as well as an experience of actually contributing to the environmental movement in a way other than just screwing in new light bulbs.
But I think that Eleen expresses best what we really get out of this, which is the actual joy of collaboration.
So she expresses here what it's like to see someone halfway across the world having taken your idea, built upon it and then acknowledging you for contributing.
If we really want to see the kind of wide consumer behavior change that we're all talking about as environmentalists and food people, maybe we just need to ditch the term "consumer" and get behind the people who are doing stuff.
Open source projects tend to have a momentum of their own.
And what we're seeing is that R&D - I - Y has moved beyond just window farms and LEDs into solar panels and aquaponic systems.
And we're building upon innovations of generations who went before us.
And we're looking ahead at generations who really need us to retool our lives now.
So we ask that you join us in rediscovering the value of citizens united, and to declare that we are all still pioneers.
I'm Denice Frohman, and this is "Accents."
my mom holds her accent like a shotgun, with two good hands.
her tongue, all brass knuckle slipping in between her lips her hips, are all laughter and wind clap.
She speaks a sanchocho of spanish and english, pushing up and against one another, in rapid fire there is no telling my mama to be "quiet," my mama do n't know "quiet."
her voice is one size better fit all and you best not tell her to hush, she waited too many years for her voice to arrive to be told it needed house keeping.
English sits in her mouth remixed so "strawberry" becomes "eh-strawbeddy" and "cookie" becomes "eh-cookie" and kitchen, key chain, and chicken all sound the same.
my mama does n't say "yes" she says, "ah ha" and suddenly the sky in her mouth becomes a Hector Lavoe song.
her tongue ca n't lay itself down flat enough for the English language, it got too much hip too much bone too much conga too much cuatro to two step got too many piano keys in between her teeth, it got too much clave too much hand clap got too much salsa to sit still it be an anxious child wanting to make Play - Doh out of concrete English be too neat for her kind of wonderful.
her words spill in conversation between women whose hands are all they got sometimes our hands are all we got and accents that remind us that we are still bomba, still plena you say "wepa" and a stranger becomes your hermano, you say "dale" and a crowd becomes a family reunion.
my mother's tongue is a telegram from her mother decorated with the coqui's of el campo so even when her lips can barely stretch themselves around english, her accent is a stubborn compass always pointing her towards home.
Everything is covered in invisible ecosystems made of tiny lifeforms: bacteria, viruses and fungi.
Our desks, our computers, our pencils, our buildings all harbor resident microbial landscapes.
As we design these things, we could be thinking about designing these invisible worlds, and also thinking about how they interact with our personal ecosystems.
Our bodies are home to trillions of microbes, and these creatures define who we are.
The microbes in your gut can influence your weight and your moods.
The microbes on your skin can help boost your immune system.
The microbes in your mouth can freshen your breath, or not, and the key thing is that our personal ecosystems interact with ecosystems on everything we touch.
So, for example, when you touch a pencil, microbial exchange happens.
If we can design the invisible ecosystems in our surroundings, this opens a path to influencing our health in unprecedented ways.
I get asked all of the time from people, "Is it possible to really design microbial ecosystems?"
And I believe the answer is yes.
I think we're doing it right now, but we're doing it unconsciously.
I'm going to share data with you from one aspect of my research focused on architecture that demonstrates how, through both conscious and unconscious design, we're impacting these invisible worlds.
This is the Lillis Business Complex at the University of Oregon, and I worked with a team of architects and biologists to sample over 300 rooms in this building.
We wanted to get something like a fossil record of the building, and to do this, we sampled dust.
From the dust, we pulled out bacterial cells, broke them open, and compared their gene sequences.
This means that people in my group were doing a lot of vacuuming during this project.
This is a picture of Tim, who, right when I snapped this picture, reminded me, he said, "Jessica, the last lab group I worked in I was doing fieldwork in the Costa Rican rainforest, and things have changed dramatically for me."
So I'm going to show you now first what we found in the offices, and we're going to look at the data through a visualization tool that I've been working on in partnership with Autodesk.
The way that you look at this data is, first, look around the outside of the circle.
You'll see broad bacterial groups, and if you look at the shape of this pink lobe, it tells you something about the relative abundance of each group.
So at 12 o'clock, you'll see that offices have a lot of alphaproteobacteria, and at one o'clock you'll see that bacilli are relatively rare.
Let's take a look at what's going on in different space types in this building.
If you look inside the restrooms, they all have really similar ecosystems, and if you were to look inside the classrooms, those also have similar ecosystems.
But if you look across these space types, you can see that they're fundamentally different from one another.
I like to think of bathrooms like a tropical rainforest.
I told Tim, "If you could just see the microbes, it's kind of like being in Costa Rica.
Kind of.
And I also like to think of offices as being a temperate grassland.
This perspective is a really powerful one for designers, because you can bring on principles of ecology, and a really important principle of ecology is dispersal, the way organisms move around.
We know that microbes are dispersed around by people and by air.
So the very first thing we wanted to do in this building was look at the air system.
Mechanical engineers design air handling units to make sure that people are comfortable, that the air flow and temperature is just right.
They do this using principles of physics and chemistry, but they could also be using biology.
If you look at the microbes in one of the air handling units in this building, you'll see that they're all very similar to one another.
And if you compare this to the microbes in a different air handling unit, you'll see that they're fundamentally different.
The rooms in this building are like islands in an archipelago, and what that means is that mechanical engineers are like eco-engineers, and they have the ability to structure biomes in this building the way that they want to.
Another facet of how microbes get around is by people, and designers often cluster rooms together to facilitate interactions among people, or the sharing of ideas, like in labs and in offices.
Given that microbes travel around with people, you might expect to see rooms that are close together have really similar biomes.
And that is exactly what we found.
If you look at classrooms right adjacent to one another, they have very similar ecosystems, but if you go to an office that is a farther walking distance away, the ecosystem is fundamentally different.
And when I see the power that dispersal has on these biogeographic patterns, it makes me think that it's possible to tackle really challenging problems, like hospital - acquired infections.
I believe this has got to be, in part, a building ecology problem.
All right, I'm going to tell you one more story about this building.
I am collaborating with Charlie Brown.
He's an architect, and Charlie is deeply concerned about global climate change.
He's dedicated his life to sustainable design.
When he met me and realized that it was possible for him to study in a quantitative way how his design choices impacted the ecology and biology of this building, he got really excited, because it added a new dimension to what he did.
He went from thinking just about energy to also starting to think about human health.
He helped design some of the air handling systems in this building and the way it was ventilated.
So what I'm first going to show you is air that we sampled outside of the building.
What you're looking at is a signature of bacterial communities in the outdoor air, and how they vary over time.
Next I'm going to show you what happened when we experimentally manipulated classrooms.
We blocked them off at night so that they got no ventilation.
A lot of buildings are operated this way, probably where you work, and companies do this to save money on their energy bill.
What we found is that these rooms remained relatively stagnant until Saturday, when we opened the vents up again.
When you walked into those rooms, they smelled really bad, and our data suggests that it had something to do with leaving behind the airborne bacterial soup from people the day before.
Contrast this to rooms that were designed using a sustainable passive design strategy where air came in from the outside through louvers.
In these rooms, the air tracked the outdoor air relatively well, and when Charlie saw this, he got really excited.
He felt like he had made a good choice with the design process because it was both energy efficient and it washed away the building's resident microbial landscape.
The examples that I just gave you are about architecture, but they're relevant to the design of anything.
Imagine designing with the kinds of microbes that we want in a plane or on a phone.
There's a new microbe, I just discovered it.
It's called BLIS, and it's been shown to both ward off pathogens and give you good breath.
Would n't it be awesome if we all had BLIS on our phones?
A conscious approach to design, I'm calling it bioinformed design, and I think it's possible.
So I begin with an advertisement inspired by George Orwell that Apple ran in 1984.
(Video) Big Brother: We are one people with one will, one resolve, one cause.
Our enemies shall talk themselves to death, and we will fight them with their own confusion.
We shall prevail.
Narrator: On January 24th, Apple Computer will introduce Macintosh.
And you'll see why 1984 wo n't be like "1984."
Rebecca MacKinnon: So the underlying message of this video remains very powerful even today.
Technology created by innovative companies will set us all free.
Fast - forward more than two decades: Apple launches the iPhone in China and censors the Dalai Lama out along with several other politically sensitive applications at the request of the Chinese government for its Chinese app store.
The American political cartoonist Mark Fiore also had his satire application censored in the United States because some of Apple's staff were concerned it would be offensive to some groups.
His app was n't reinstated until he won the Pulitzer Prize.
The German magazine Stern, a news magazine, had its app censored because the Apple nannies deemed it to be a little bit too racy for their users, and despite the fact that this magazine is perfectly legal for sale on newsstands throughout Germany.
And more controversially, recently, Apple censored a Palestinian protest app after the Israeli government voiced concerns that it might be used to organize violent attacks.
So here's the thing.
We have a situation where private companies are applying censorship standards that are often quite arbitrary and generally more narrow than the free speech constitutional standards that we have in democracies.
Or they're responding to censorship requests by authoritarian regimes that do not reflect consent of the governed.
Or they're responding to requests and concerns by governments that have no jurisdiction over many, or most, of the users and viewers who are interacting with the content in question.
So here's the situation.
In a pre-Internet world, sovereignty over our physical freedoms, or lack thereof, was controlled almost entirely by nation - states.
But now we have this new layer of private sovereignty in cyberspace.
And their decisions about software coding, engineering, design, terms of service all act as a kind of law that shapes what we can and can not do with our digital lives.
And their sovereignties, cross - cutting, globally interlinked, can in some ways challenge the sovereignties of nation - states in very exciting ways, but sometimes also act to project and extend it at a time when control over what people can and can not do with information has more effect than ever on the exercise of power in our physical world.
After all, even the leader of the free world needs a little help from the sultan of Facebookistan if he wants to get reelected next year.
And these platforms were certainly very helpful to activists in Tunisia and Egypt this past spring and beyond.
As Wael Ghonim, the Google - Egyptian - executive by day, secret - Facebook - activist by night, famously said to CNN after Mubarak stepped down, "If you want to liberate a society, just give them the Internet."
But overthrowing a government is one thing and building a stable democracy is a bit more complicated.
On the left there's a photo taken by an Egyptian activist who was part of the storming of the Egyptian state security offices in March.
And many of the agents shredded as many of the documents as they could and left them behind in piles.
But some of the files were left behind intact, and activists, some of them, found their own surveillance dossiers full of transcripts of their email exchanges, their cellphone text message exchanges, even Skype conversations.
And one activist actually found a contract from a Western company for the sale of surveillance technology to the Egyptian security forces.
And Egyptian activists are assuming that these technologies for surveillance are still being used by the transitional authorities running the networks there.
And in Tunisia, censorship actually began to return in May -- not nearly as extensively as under President Ben Ali.
But you'll see here a blocked page of what happens when you try to reach certain Facebook pages and some other websites that the transitional authorities have determined might incite violence.
In protest over this, blogger Slim Amamou, who had been jailed under Ben Ali and then became part of the transitional government after the revolution, he resigned in protest from the cabinet.
But there's been a lot of debate in Tunisia about how to handle this kind of problem.
In fact, on Twitter, there were a number of people who were supportive of the revolution who said, "Well actually, we do want democracy and free expression, but there is some kinds of speech that need to be off - bounds because it's too violent and it might be destabilizing for our democracy.
But the problem is, how do you decide who is in power to make these decisions and how do you make sure that they do not abuse their power?
As Riadh Guerfali, the veteran digital activist from Tunisia, remarked over this incident, "Before, things were simple: you had the good guys on one side and the bad guys on the other.
Today, things are a lot more subtle.
The reality is that even in democratic societies today, we do not have good answers for how you balance the need for security and law enforcement on one hand and protection of civil liberties and free speech on the other in our digital networks.
In fact, in the United States, whatever you may think of Julian Assange, even people who are not necessarily big fans of his are very concerned about the way in which the United States government and some companies have handled Wikileaks.
Amazon webhosting dropped Wikileaks as a customer after receiving a complaint from U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman, despite the fact that Wikileaks had not been charged, let alone convicted, of any crime.
So we assume that the Internet is a border - busting technology.
This is a map of social networks worldwide, and certainly Facebook has conquered much of the world -- which is either a good or a bad thing, depending on how you like the way Facebook manages its service.
But borders do persist in some parts of cyberspace.
In Brazil and Japan, it's for unique cultural and linguistic reasons.
But if you look at China, Vietnam and a number of the former Soviet states, what's happening there is more troubling.
You have a situation where the relationship between government and local social networking companies is creating a situation where, effectively, the empowering potential of these platforms is being constrained because of these relationships between companies and government.
Now in China, you have the "great firewall," as it's well - known, that blocks Facebook and Twitter and now Google + and many of the other overseas websites.
And that's done in part with the help from Western technology.
But that's only half of the story.
The other part of the story are requirements that the Chinese government places on all companies operating on the Chinese Internet, known as a system of self - discipline.
In plain English, that means censorship and surveillance of their users.
And this is a ceremony I actually attended in 2009 where the Internet Society of China presented awards to the top 20 Chinese companies that are best at exercising self - discipline -- i.e. policing their content.
And Robin Li, CEO of Baidu, China's dominant search engine, was one of the recipients.
In Russia, they do not generally block the Internet and directly censor websites.
But this is a website called Rospil that's an anti-corruption site.
And earlier this year, there was a troubling incident where people who had made donations to Rospil through a payments processing system called Yandex Money suddenly received threatening phone calls from members of a nationalist party who had obtained details about donors to Rospil through members of the security services who had somehow obtained this information from people at Yandex Money.
This has a chilling effect on people's ability to use the Internet to hold government accountable.
So we have a situation in the world today where in more and more countries the relationship between citizens and governments is mediated through the Internet, which is comprised primarily of privately owned and operated services.
So the important question, I think, is not this debate over whether the Internet is going to help the good guys more than the bad guys.
Of course, it's going to empower whoever is most skilled at using the technology and best understands the Internet in comparison with whoever their adversary is.
The most urgent question we need to be asking today is how do we make sure that the Internet evolves in a citizen - centric manner.
Because I think all of you will agree that the only legitimate purpose of government is to serve citizens, and I would argue that the only legitimate purpose of technology is to improve our lives, not to manipulate or enslave us.
So the question is, we know how to hold government accountable.
We do n't necessarily always do it very well, but we have a sense of what the models are, politically and institutionally, to do that.
How do you hold the sovereigns of cyberspace accountable to the public interest when most CEO's argue that their main obligation is to maximize shareholder profit?
And government regulation often is n't helping all that much.
You have situations, for instance, in France where president Sarkozy tells the CEO's of Internet companies, "We're the only legitimate representatives of the public interest."
But then he goes and champions laws like the infamous "three- strikes" law that would disconnect citizens from the Internet for file sharing, which has been condemned by the U.N. Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Expression as being a disproportionate violation of citizens' right to communications, and has raised questions amongst civil society groups about whether some political representatives are more interested in preserving the interests of the entertainment industry than they are in defending the rights of their citizens.
And here in the United Kingdom there's also concern over a law called the Digital Economy Act that's placing more onus on private intermediaries to police citizen behavior.
So what we need to recognize is that if we want to have a citizen - centric Internet in the future, we need a broader and more sustained Internet freedom movement.
After all, companies did n't stop polluting groundwater as a matter of course, or employing 10 - year - olds as a matter of course, just because executives woke up one day and decided it was the right thing to do.
It was the result of decades of sustained activism, shareholder advocacy and consumer advocacy.
Similarly, governments do n't enact intelligent environmental and labor laws just because politicians wake up one day.
It's the result of very sustained and prolonged political activism that you get the right regulations, and that you get the right corporate behavior.
We need to make the same approach with the Internet.
We also are going to need political innovation.
Eight hundred years ago, approximately, the barons of England decided that the Divine Right of Kings was no longer working for them so well, and they forced King John to sign the Magna Carta, which recognized that even the king who claimed to have divine rule still had to abide by a basic set of rules.
This set off a cycle of what we can call political innovation, which led eventually to the idea of consent of the governed -- which was implemented for the first time by that radical revolutionary government in America across the pond.
So now we need to figure out how to build consent of the networked.
At the moment, we still do n't know.
But it's going to require innovation that's not only going to need to focus on politics, on geopolitics, but it's also going to need to deal with questions of business management, investor behavior, consumer choice and even software design and engineering.
Each and every one of us has a vital part to play in building the kind of world in which government and technology serve the world's people and not the other way around.
(Applause)
Being a child, and sort of crawling around the house, I remember these Turkish carpets, and there were these scenes, these battle scenes, these love scenes.
I mean, look, this animal is trying to fight back this spear from this soldier.
And my mom took these pictures actually, last week, of our carpets, and I remember this to this day.
There was another object, this sort of towering piece of furniture with creatures and gargoyles and nudity -- pretty scary stuff, when you're a little kid.
What I remember today from this is that objects tell stories, so storytelling has been a really strong influence in my work.
And then there was another influence.
I was a teenager, and at 15 or 16, I guess like all teenagers, we want to just do what we love and what we believe in.
And so, I fused together the two things I loved the most, which was skiing and windsurfing.
Those are pretty good escapes from the drab weather in Switzerland.
So, I created this compilation of the two: I took my skis and I took a board and I put a mast foot in there, and some foot straps, and some metal fins, and here I was, going really fast on frozen lakes.
It was really a death trap.
I mean, it was incredible, it worked incredibly well, but it was really dangerous.
And I realized then I had to go to design school.
(Laughter) I mean, look at those graphics there.
(Laughter) So, I went to design school, and it was the early '90s when I finished.
And I saw something extraordinary happening in Silicon Valley, so I wanted to be there, and I saw that the computer was coming into our homes, that it had to change in order to be with us in our homes.
And so I got myself a job and I was working for a consultancy, and we would get in to these meetings, and these managers would come in, and they would say, "Well, what we're going to do here is really important, you know."
And they would give the projects code names, you know, mostly from "Star Wars," actually: things like C3PO, Yoda, Luke.
So, in anticipation, I would be this young designer in the back of the room, and I would raise my hand, and I would ask questions.
I mean, in retrospect, probably stupid questions, but things like, "What's this Caps Lock key for?"
or "What's this Num Lock key for?"
You know, that thing?
You know, do people really use it?
Do they need it?
Do they want it in their homes? "
(Laughter) What I realized then is, they did n't really want to change the legacy stuff; they did n't want to change the insides.
They were really looking for us, the designers, to create the skins, to put some pretty stuff outside of the box.
And I did n't want to be a colorist.
It was n't what I wanted to do.
I did n't want to be a stylist in this way.
And then I saw this quote: "advertising is the price companies pay for being unoriginal."
(Laughter) So, I had to start on my own.
So I moved to San Francisco, and I started a little company, fuseproject.
And what I wanted to work on is important stuff.
And I wanted to really not just work on the skins, but I wanted to work on the entire human experience.
And so the first projects were sort of humble, but they took technology and maybe made it into things that people would use in a new way, and maybe finding some new functionality.
This is a watch we made for Mini Cooper, the car company, right when it launched, and it's the first watch that has a display that switches from horizontal to vertical.
And that allows me to check my timer discretely, here, without bending my elbow.
And other projects, which were really about transformation, about matching the human need.
This is a little piece of furniture for an Italian manufacturer, and it ships completely flat, and then it folds into a coffee table and a stool and what not.
And something a little bit more experimental: this is a light fixture for Swarovski, and what it does is, it changes shape.
So, it goes from a circle, to a round, to a square, to a figure eight.
And just by drawing on a little computer tablet, the entire light fixture adjusts to what shape you want.
And then finally, the leaf lamp for Herman Miller.
This is a pretty involved process; it took us about four and a half years.
But I really was looking for creating a unique experience of light, a new experience of light.
So, we had to design both the light and the light bulb.
And that's a unique opportunity, I would say, in design.
And the new experience I was looking for is giving the choice for the user to go from a warm, sort of glowing kind of mood light, all the way to a bright work light.
So, the light bulb actually does that.
It allows the person to switch, and to mix these two colorations.
And it's done in a very simple way: one just touches the base of the light, and on one side, you can mix the brightness, and on the other, the coloration of the light.
So, all of these projects have a humanistic sense to them, and I think as designers we need to really think about how we can create a different relationship between our work and the world, whether it's for business, or, as I'm going to show, on some civic - type projects.
Because I think everybody agrees that as designers we bring value to business, value to the users also, but I think it's the values that we put into these projects that ultimately create the greater value.
And the values we bring can be about environmental issues, about sustainability, about lower power consumption.
You know, they can be about function and beauty; they can be about business strategy.
But designers are really the glue that brings these things together.
So Jawbone is a project that you're familiar with, and it has a humanistic technology.
It feels your skin. It rests on your skin, and it knows when it is you're talking.
And by knowing when it is you're talking, it gets rid of the other noises that it knows about, which is the environmental noises.
But the other thing that is humanistic about Jawbone is that we really decided to take out all the techie stuff, and all the nerdy stuff out of it, and try to make it as beautiful as we can.
I mean, think about it: the care we take in selecting sunglasses, or jewelry, or accessories is really important, so if it is n't beautiful, it really does n't belong on your face.
And this is what we're pursuing here.
But how we work on Jawbone is really unique.
I want to point at something here, on the left.
This is the board, this is one of the things that goes inside that makes this technology work.
But this is the design process: there's somebody changing the board, putting tracers on the board, changing the location of the ICs, as the designers on the other side are doing the work.
So, it's not about slapping skins, anymore, on a technology.
It's really about designing from the inside out.
And then, on the other side of the room, the designers are making small adjustments, sketching, drawing by hand, putting it in the computer.
And it's what I call being design driven.
You know, there is some push and pull, but design is really helping define the whole experience from the inside out.
And then, of course, design is never done.
And this is -- the other new way that is unique in how we work is, because it's never done, you have to do all this other stuff.
The packaging, and the website, and you need to continue to really touch the user, in many ways.
But how do you retain somebody, when it's never done?
And Hosain Rahman, the CEO of Aliph Jawbone, you know, really understands that you need a different structure.
So, in a way, the different structure is that we're partners, it's a partnership.
We can continue to work and dedicate ourselves to this project, and then we also share in the rewards.
And here's another project, another partnership - type approach.
This is called Y Water, and it's this guy from Los Angeles, Thomas Arndt, Austrian originally, who came to us, and all he wanted to do was to create a healthy drink, or an organic drink for his kids, to replace the high - sugar - content sodas that he's trying to get them away from.
So, we worked on this bottle, and it's completely symmetrical in every dimension.
And this allows the bottle to turn into a game.
The bottles connect together, and you can create different shapes, different forms.
(Laughter) (Applause) Thank you.
(Applause) And then while we were doing this, the shape of the bottle upside down reminded us of a Y, and then we thought, well these words, "why" and "why not," are probably the most important words that kids ask.
So we called it Y Water. And so this is another place where it all comes together in the same room: the three - dimensional design, the ideas, the branding, it all becomes deeply connected.
And then the other thing about this project is, we bring intellectual property, we bring a marketing approach, we bring all this stuff, but I think, at the end of the day, what we bring is these values, and these values create a soul for the companies we work with.
And it's especially rewarding when your design work becomes a creative endeavor, when others can be creative and do more with it.
Here's another project, which I think really emulates that.
This is the One Laptop per Child, the $100 laptop.
This picture is incredible.
In Nigeria, people carry their most precious belongings on their heads.
This girl is going to school with a laptop on her head.
I mean, to me, it just means so much.
But when Nicholas Negroponte -- and he has spoken about this project a lot, he's the founder of OLPC -- came to us about two and a half years ago, there were some clear ideas.
He wanted to bring education and he wanted to bring technology, and those are pillars of his life, but also pillars of the mission of One Laptop per Child.
But the third pillar that he talked about was design.
And at the time, I was n't really working on computers.
I did n't really want to, from the previous adventure.
But what he said was really significant, is that design was going to be why the kids were going to love this product, how we were going to make it low cost, robust.
And plus, he said he was going to get rid of the Caps Lock key -- (Laughter) -- and the Num Lock key, too.
So, I was convinced.
We designed it to be iconic, to look different. To look like it's for a kid, but not like a toy.
And then the integration of all these great technologies, which you've heard about, the Wi - Fi antennas that allow the kids to connect; the screen, which you can read in sunlight; the keyboard, which is made out of rubber, and it's protected from the environment.
You know, all these great technologies really happened because of the passion and the OLPC people and the engineers.
They fought the suppliers, they fought the manufacturers.
I mean, they fought like animals for this to remain they way it is.
And in a way, it is that will that makes projects like this one -- allows the process from not destroying the original idea.
And I think this is something really important.
So, now you get these pictures -- you get up in the morning, and you see the kids in Nigeria and you see them in Uruguay with their computers, and in Mongolia.
And we went away from obviously the beige.
I mean it's colorful, it's fun.
In fact, you can see each logo is a little bit different.
It's because we were able to run, during the manufacturing process, 20 colors for the X and the O, which is the name of the computer, and by mixing them on the manufacturing floor, you get 20 times 20: you get 400 different options there.
So, the lessons from seeing the kids using them in the developing world are incredible.
But this is my nephew, Anthony, in Switzerland, and he had the laptop for an afternoon, and I had to take it back.
It was hard.
(Laughter) And it was a prototype.
And a month and a half later, I come back to Switzerland, and there he is playing with his own version.
(Laughter) Like paper, paper and cardboard.
So, I'm going to finish with one last project, and this is a little bit more of adult play.
(Laughter) Some of you might have heard about the New York City condom.
It's actually just launched, actually launched on Valentine's Day, February 14, about 10 days ago.
So, the Department of Health in New York came to us, and they needed a way to distribute 36 million condoms for free to the citizens of New York.
So a pretty big endeavor, and we worked on the dispensers.
These are the dispensers.
There's this friendly shape.
It's a little bit like designing a fire hydrant, and it has to be easily serviceable: you have to know where it is and what it does.
And we also designed the condoms themselves.
And I was just in New York at the launch, and I went to see all these places where they're installed: this is at a Puerto Rican little mom - and - pop store; at a bar in Christopher Street; at a pool hall.
I mean, they're being installed in homeless clinics -- everywhere.
And here's the public service announcement for this project.
(Music) (Laughter) Get some.
(Applause) So, this is really where design is able to create a conversation.
I was in these venues, and people were, you know, really into getting them.
They were excited.
It was breaking the ice, it was getting over a stigma, and I think that's also what design can do.
So, I was going to throw some condoms in the room and what not, but I'm not sure it's the etiquette here.
(Laughter) Yeah? All right, all right.
I have only a few.
(Laughter) (Applause) So, I have more, you can always ask me for some more later.
(Laughter) And if anybody asks why you're carrying a condom, you can just say you like the design.
(Laughter) So, I'll finish with just one thought: if we all work together on creating value, but if we really keep in mind the values of the work that we do, I think we can change the work that we do.
We can change these values, can change the companies we work with, and eventually, together, maybe we can change the world.
So, thank you.
What if you could only see one color?
Imagine, for instance, that you could only see things that were red and that everything else was completely invisible to you.
As it turns out, that's how you live your life all the time because your eyes can only see a minuscule part of the full spectrum of light.
Different kinds of light are all around you everyday but are invisible to the human eye, from the radio waves that carry your favorite songs, to the x - rays doctors use to see inside of you, to the microwaves that heat up your food.
In order to understand how these can all be light, we'll need to know a thing or two about what light is.
Light is electromagnetic radiation that acts like both a wave and a particle.
Light waves are kind of like waves on the ocean.
There are big waves and small waves, waves that crash on the shore one right after the other, and waves that only roll in every so often.
The size of a wave is called its wavelength, and how often it comes by is called its frequency.
Imagine being a boat in that ocean, bobbing up and down as the waves go by.
If the waves that day have long wavelengths, they'll make you bob only so often, or at a low frequency.
If the waves, instead, have short wavelengths, they'll be close together, and you'll bob up and down much more often, at a high frequency.
Different kinds of light are all waves, they just have different wavelengths and frequencies.
If you know the wavelength or frequency of a wave of light, you can also figure out it s energy.
Long wavelengths have low energies, while short wavelengths have high energies.
It's easy to remember if you think about being in that boat.
If you were out sailing on a day with short, choppy waves, you'd probably be pretty high energy yourself, running around to keep things from falling over.
But on a long wavelength sea, you'd be rolling along, relaxed, low energy.
The energy of light tells us how it will interact with matter, for example, the cells of our eyes.
When we see, it's because the energy of light stimulates a receptor in our eye called the retina.
Our retina are only sensitive to light with a very small range in energy, and so we call that range of light visible light.
Inside our retina are special receptors called rods and cones.
The rods measure brightness, so we know how much light there is.
The cones are in charge of what color of light we see because different cones are sensitive to different energies of light.
Some cones are more excited by light that is long wavelength and low energy, and other cones are more excited by short wavelength, high - energy light.
When light hits our eye, the relative amount of energy each cone measures signals our brain to perceive colors.
The rainbow we perceive is actually visible light in order of its energy.
At one side of the rainbow is low - energy light we see as red, and at the other side is high - energy light we see as blue.
If light shines on us that has an energy our retina ca n't measure, we wo n't be able to see it.
Light that is too short wavelength or high energy gets absorbed by the eye's surface before it can even get to the retina, and light that is too long wavelength does n't have enough energy to stimulate our retina at all.
The only thing that makes one kind of light different from another is its wavelength.
Radio waves have long wavelengths, while x - rays have short wavelengths.
And visible light, the kind you can actually see, is somewhere in between.
Even though our eyes ca n't detect light outside of the visible range, we can build special detectors that are stimulated by these other wavelengths of light, kind of like digital eyes.
With these devices, we can measure the light that is there, even though we ca n't see it ourselves.
Even though they seem different, the warmth you feel from a crackling fire is the same as the sun shining on you on a beautiful day, the same as ultraviolet light you put on sunscreen to protect yourself from, the same thing as your TV, your radio, and your microwave.
Now, those examples are all things here on Earth, things you experience in your everyday life, but here's something even more amazing.
When you think of the night sky, you probably think of being able to see the stars shining with your own eyes, but that's just visible light, which you now know is only a tiny part of the full spectrum.
If we had to draw the universe and could only use visible light, it would be like having only one crayon -- pretty sad.
To see the universe in its full spectrum, we need to have the right eyes, and that means using special telescopes that can help us see beyond visible light.
You've probably heard of the Hubble Space Telescope and seen its beautiful pictures taken in visible and ultraviolet light.
But you might not know that there are 20 space telescopes in orbit, missions that can each see part of the full spectrum of light.
With telescopes acting as our virtual eyes, both in space and here on Earth, we can see some amazing things.
And the coolest thing of all, no matter the wavelength or energy, the light that we see out in the distant universe is the same thing as the light that we can experience and study here on Earth.
So, since we know the physics of how x - ray, ultraviolet light, or microwaves work here, we can study the light of a distant star or galaxy and know what kinds of things are happening there too.
So, as you go about your daily life, think beyond what your eyes can and ca n't see.
Knowing just a little bit about the natural world can help you perceive the full spectrum around you all the time.
Our ability to create and sustain economic growth is the defining challenge of our time.
Of course there are other challenges -- health care, disease burdens and pandemics, environmental challenges and, of course, radicalized terrorism.
However, to the extent that we can actually solve the economic growth challenge, it will take us a long way to solving the challenges that I've just elucidated.
More importantly, unless and until we solve economic growth and create sustainable, long - term economic growth, we'll be unable to address the seemingly intractable challenges that continue to pervade the globe today, whether it's health care, education or economic development.
The fundamental question is this: How are we going to create economic growth in advanced and developed economies like the United States and across Europe at a time when they continue to struggle to create economic growth after the financial crisis?
They continue to underperform and to see an erosion in the three key drivers of economic growth: capital, labor and productivity.
In particular, these developed economies continue to see debts and deficits, the decline and erosion of both the quality and quantity of labor and they also see productivity stalling.
In a similar vein, how are we going to create economic growth in the emerging markets, where 90 percent of the world's population lives and where, on average, 70 percent of the population is under the age of 25?
In these countries, it is essential that they grow at a minimum of seven percent a year in order to put a dent in poverty and to double per capita incomes in one generation.
And yet today, the largest emerging economies -- countries with at least 50 million people -- continue to struggle to reach that seven percent magic mark.
Worse than that, countries like India, Russia, South Africa, Brazil and even China are falling below that seven percent number and, in many cases, actually regressing.
Economic growth matters.
With economic growth, countries and societies enter into a virtuous cycle of upward mobility, opportunity and improved living standards.
Without growth, countries contract and atrophy, not just in the annals of economic statistics but also in the meaning of life and how lives are lived.
Economic growth matters powerfully for the individual.
If growth wanes, the risk to human progress and the risk of political and social instability rises, and societies become dimmer, coarser and smaller.
The context matters.
And countries in emerging markets do not need to grow at the same rates as developed countries.
Now, I know some of you in this room find this to be a risky proposition.
There are some people here who will turn around and be quite disillusioned by what's happened around the world and basically ascribe that to economic growth.
You worry about the overpopulation of the planet.
And looking at the UN's recent statistics and projections that the world will have 11 billion people on the planet before it plateaus in 2100, you're concerned about what that does to natural resources -- arable land, potable water, energy and minerals.
You are also concerned about the degradation of the environment.
And you worry about how man, embodied in the corporate globalist, has become greedy and corrupt.
But I'm here to tell you today that economic growth has been the backbone of changes in living standards of millions of people around the world.
And more importantly, it's not just economic growth that has been driven by capitalism.
The definition of capitalism, very simply put, is that the factors of production, such as trade and industry, capital and labor, are left in the hands of the private sector and not the state.
It's really essential here that we understand that fundamentally the critique is not for economic growth per se but what has happened to capitalism.
Economic growth needs capitalism, but it needs it to work properly.
And as I mentioned a moment ago, the core of the capitalist system has been defined by private actors.
And even this, however, is a very simplistic dichotomy.
Capitalism: good; non-capitalism: bad.
When in practical experience, capitalism is much more of a spectrum.
And we have countries such as China, which have practiced more state capitalism, and we have countries like the Unites States which are more market capitalist.
Our efforts to critique the capitalist system, however, have tended to focus on countries like China that are in fact not blatantly market capitalism.
However, there is a real reason and real concern for us to now focus our attentions on purer forms of capitalism, particularly those embodied by the United States.
This is really important because this type of capitalism has increasingly been afforded the critique that it is now fostering corruption and, worse still, it's increasing income inequality -- the idea that the few are benefiting at the expense of the many.
The two really critical questions that we need to address is how can we fix capitalism so that it can help create economic growth but at the same time can help to address social ills.
In order to think about that framing, we have to ask ourselves, how does capitalism work today?
Very simplistically, capitalism is set on the basis of an individual utility maximizer -- a selfish individual who goes after what he or she wants.
And only after they've maximized their utility do they then decide it's important to provide support to other social contracts.
Of course, in this system governments do tax, and they use part of their revenues to fund social programs, recognizing that government's role is not just regulation but also to be arbiter of social goods.
But nevertheless, this framework -- this two - stage framework -- is the basis from which we must now start to think about how we can improve the capitalist model.
I would argue that there are two sides to this challenge.
First of all, we can draw on the right - wing policies to see what could be beneficial for us to think about how we can improve capitalism.
In particular, right - leaning policies have tended to focus on things like conditional transfers, where we pay and reward people for doing the things that we actually think can help enhance economic growth.
For example, sending children to school, parents could earn money for that, or getting their children inoculated or immunized, parents could get paid for doing that.
Now, quite apart from the debate on whether or not we should be paying people to do what we think they should do anyway, the fact of the matter is that pay for performance has actually yielded some positive results in places like Mexico, in Brazil and also in pilot programs in New York.
But there are also benefits and significant changes underway on left - leaning policies.
Arguments that government should expand its role and responsibility so that it's not so narrowly defined and that government should be much more of an arbiter of the factors of production have become commonplace with the success of China.
But also we've started to have debates about how the role of the private sector should move away from just being a profit motive and really be more engaged in the delivery of social programs.
Things like the corporate social responsibility programs, albeit small in scale, are moving in that right direction.
Of course, left - leaning policies have also tended to blur the lines between government, NGOs and private sector.
Two very good examples of this are the 19th - century United States, when the infrastructure rollout was really about public - private partnerships.
More recently, of course, the advent of the Internet has also proven to the world that public and private can work together for the betterment of society.
My fundamental message to you is this: We can not continue to try and solve the world economic growth challenges by being dogmatic and being unnecessarily ideological.
In order to create sustainable, long - term economic growth and solve the challenges and social ills that continue to plague the world today, we're going to have to be more broad - minded about what might work.
Ultimately, we have to recognize that ideology is the enemy of growth.
(Applause) Bruno Giussani: I want to ask a couple of questions, Dambisa, because one could react to your last sentence by saying growth is also an ideology, it's possibly the dominant ideology of our times.
What do you say to those who react that way?
DM: Well, I think that that's completely legitimate, and I think that we're already having that discussion.
There's a lot of work going on around happiness and other metrics being used for measuring people's success and improvements in living standards.
And so I think that we should be open to what could deliver improvements in people's living standards and continue to reduce poverty around the world.
BG: So you're basically pleading for rehabilitating growth, but the only way for that happen without compromising the capacity of the earth, to take us on a long journey, is for economic growth somehow to decouple from the underlying use of resources.
Do you see that happening?
DM: Well, I think that I'm more optimistic about human ability and ingenuity.
I think if we start to constrain ourselves using the finite, scarce and depleting resources that we know today, we could get quite negative and quite concerned about the way the world is.
However, we've seen the Club of Rome, we've seen previous claims that the world would be running out of resources, and it's not to argue that those things are not valid.
But I think, with ingenuity we could see desalination, I think we could reinvest in energy, so that we can actually get better outcomes.
And so in that sense, I'm much more optimistic about what humans can do.
BG: The thing that strikes me about your proposals for rehabilitating growth and taking a different direction is that you're kind of suggesting to fix capitalism with more capitalism -- with putting a price tag on good behavior as incentive or developing a bigger role for business in social issues.
Is that what you're suggesting?
DM: I'm suggesting we have to be open - minded.
I think it is absolutely the case that traditional models of economic growth are not working the way we would like them to.
And I think it's no accident that today the largest economy in the world, the United States, has democracy, liberal democracy, as it's core political stance and it has free market capitalism -- to the extent that it is free -- free market capitalism as its economic stance.
The second largest economy is China.
It has deprioritized democracy and it has state capitalism, which is a completely different model.
These two countries, completely different political models and completely different economic models, and yet they have the same income inequality number measured as a Gini coefficient.
I think those are the debates we should have, because it's not clear at all what model we should be adopting, and I think there needs to be much more discourse and much more humility about what we know and what we do n't know.
BG: One last question.
The COP21 is going on in Paris.
If you could send a tweet to all the heads of state and heads of delegations there, what would you say?
DM: Again, I would be very much about being open - minded.
As you're aware, the issues around the environmental concerns have been on the agenda many times now -- in Copenhagen, '72 in Stockholm -- and we keep revisiting these issues partly because there is not a fundamental agreement, in fact there's a schism between what the developed countries believe and want and what emerging market countries want.
Emerging market countries need to continue to create economic growth so that we do n't have political uncertainty in the those countries.
Developed countries recognize that they have a real, important responsibility not only just to manage their CO2 emissions and some of the degradation that they're contributing to the world, but also as trendsetters in R&D.
And so they have to come to the table as well.
But in essence, it can not be a situation where we start ascribing policies to the emerging markets without developed countries themselves also taking quite a swipe at what they're doing both in demand and supply in developed markets.
BG: Dambisa, thank you for coming to TED.
DM: Thank you very much.
Statistics are persuasive.
So much so that people, organizations, and whole countries base some of their most important decisions on organized data.
But there's a problem with that.
Any set of statistics might have something lurking inside it, something that can turn the results completely upside down.
For example, imagine you need to choose between two hospitals for an elderly relative's surgery.
Out of each hospital's last 1000 patient's, 900 survived at Hospital A, while only 800 survived at Hospital B.
So it looks like Hospital A is the better choice.
But before you make your decision, remember that not all patients arrive at the hospital with the same level of health.
And if we divide each hospital's last 1000 patients into those who arrived in good health and those who arrived in poor health, the picture starts to look very different.
Hospital A had only 100 patients who arrived in poor health, of which 30 survived.
But Hospital B had 400, and they were able to save 210.
So Hospital B is the better choice for patients who arrive at hospital in poor health, with a survival rate of 52.5%.
And what if your relative's health is good when she arrives at the hospital?
Strangely enough, Hospital B is still the better choice, with a survival rate of over 98%.
So how can Hospital A have a better overall survival rate if Hospital B has better survival rates for patients in each of the two groups?
What we've stumbled upon is a case of Simpson's paradox, where the same set of data can appear to show opposite trends depending on how it's grouped.
This often occurs when aggregated data hides a conditional variable, sometimes known as a lurking variable, which is a hidden additional factor that significantly influences results.
Here, the hidden factor is the relative proportion of patients who arrive in good or poor health.
Simpson's paradox is n't just a hypothetical scenario.
It pops up from time to time in the real world, sometimes in important contexts.
One study in the UK appeared to show that smokers had a higher survival rate than nonsmokers over a twenty - year time period.
That is, until dividing the participants by age group showed that the nonsmokers were significantly older on average, and thus, more likely to die during the trial period, precisely because they were living longer in general.
Here, the age groups are the lurking variable, and are vital to correctly interpret the data.
In another example, an analysis of Florida's death penalty cases seemed to reveal no racial disparity in sentencing between black and white defendants convicted of murder.
But dividing the cases by the race of the victim told a different story.
In either situation, black defendants were more likely to be sentenced to death.
The slightly higher overall sentencing rate for white defendants was due to the fact that cases with white victims were more likely to elicit a death sentence than cases where the victim was black, and most murders occurred between people of the same race.
So how do we avoid falling for the paradox?
Unfortunately, there's no one - size - fits - all answer.
Data can be grouped and divided in any number of ways, and overall numbers may sometimes give a more accurate picture than data divided into misleading or arbitrary categories.
All we can do is carefully study the actual situations the statistics describe and consider whether lurking variables may be present.
Otherwise, we leave ourselves vulnerable to those who would use data to manipulate others and promote their own agendas.
It's a diagram of the visual system.
And some things look very familiar today.
Two eyes at the bottom, optic nerve flowing out from the back.
There's a very large nose that does n't seem to be connected to anything in particular.
And if we compare this to more recent representations of the visual system, you'll see that things have gotten substantially more complicated over the intervening thousand years.
And that's because today we can see what's inside of the brain, rather than just looking at its overall shape.
Imagine you wanted to understand how a computer works and all you could see was a keyboard, a mouse, a screen.
You really would be kind of out of luck.
You want to be able to open it up, crack it open, look at the wiring inside.
And up until a little more than a century ago, nobody was able to do that with the brain.
Nobody had had a glimpse of the brain's wiring.
And that's because if you take a brain out of the skull and you cut a thin slice of it, put it under even a very powerful microscope, there's nothing there.
It's gray, formless.
There's no structure.
It wo n't tell you anything.
And this all changed in the late 19th century.
Suddenly, new chemical stains for brain tissue were developed and they gave us our first glimpses at brain wiring.
The computer was cracked open.
So what really launched modern neuroscience was a stain called the Golgi stain.
And it works in a very particular way.
Instead of staining all of the cells inside of a tissue, it somehow only stains about one percent of them.
It clears the forest, reveals the trees inside.
If everything had been labeled, nothing would have been visible.
Spanish neuroanatomist Santiago Ramon y Cajal, who's widely considered the father of modern neuroscience, applied this Golgi stain, which yields data which looks like this, and really gave us the modern notion of the nerve cell, the neuron.
And if you're thinking of the brain as a computer, this is the transistor.
And very quickly Cajal realized that neurons do n't operate alone, but rather make connections with others that form circuits just like in a computer.
Today, a century later, when researchers want to visualize neurons, they light them up from the inside rather than darkening them.
And there's several ways of doing this.
But one of the most popular ones involves green fluorescent protein.
Now green fluorescent protein, which oddly enough comes from a bioluminescent jellyfish, is very useful.
Because if you can get the gene for green fluorescent protein and deliver it to a cell, that cell will glow green -- or any of the many variants now of green fluorescent protein, you get a cell to glow many different colors.
And so coming back to the brain, this is from a genetically engineered mouse called "Brainbow."
And it's so called, of course, because all of these neurons are glowing different colors.
Now sometimes neuroscientists need to identify individual molecular components of neurons, molecules, rather than the entire cell.
And there's several ways of doing this, but one of the most popular ones involves using antibodies.
And you're familiar, of course, with antibodies as the henchmen of the immune system.
But it turns out that they're so useful to the immune system because they can recognize specific molecules, like, for example, the coat protein of a virus that's invading the body.
And researchers have used this fact in order to recognize specific molecules inside of the brain, recognize specific substructures of the cell and identify them individually.
And a lot of the images I've been showing you here are very beautiful, but they're also very powerful.
They have great explanatory power.
This, for example, is an antibody staining against serotonin transporters in a slice of mouse brain.
And you've heard of serotonin, of course, in the context of diseases like depression and anxiety.
You've heard of SSRIs, which are drugs that are used to treat these diseases.
And in order to understand how serotonin works, it's critical to understand where the serontonin machinery is.
And antibody stainings like this one can be used to understand that sort of question.
I'd like to leave you with the following thought: Green fluorescent protein and antibodies are both totally natural products at the get - go.
They were evolved by nature in order to get a jellyfish to glow green for whatever reason, or in order to detect the coat protein of an invading virus, for example.
And only much later did scientists come onto the scene and say, "Hey, these are tools, these are functions that we could use in our own research tool palette."
And instead of applying feeble human minds to designing these tools from scratch, there were these ready - made solutions right out there in nature developed and refined steadily for millions of years by the greatest engineer of all.
I was raised in Seoul, Korea, and moved to New York City in 1999 to attend college.
I was pre-med at the time, and I thought I would become a surgeon because I was interested in anatomy and dissecting animals really piqued my curiosity.
At the same time, I fell in love with New York City.
I started to realize that I could look at the whole city as a living organism.
I wanted to dissect it and look into its unseen layers.
And the way to it, for me, was through artistic means.
So, eventually I decided to pursue an MFA instead of an M.D.
and in grad school I became interested in creatures that dwell in the hidden corners of the city.
In New York City, rats are part of commuters' daily lives.
Most people ignore them or are frightened of them.
But I took a liking to them because they dwell on the fringes of society.
And even though they're used in labs to promote human lives, they're also considered pests.
I also started looking around in the city and trying to photograph them.
One day, in the subway, I was snapping pictures of the tracks hoping to catch a rat or two, and a man came up to me and said, "You ca n't take photographs here.
The MTA will confiscate your camera. "
I'll follow the rats. "
Then I started going into the tunnels, which made me realize that there's a whole new dimension to the city that I never saw before and most people do n't get to see.
Around the same time, I met like - minded individuals who call themselves urban explorers, adventurers, spelunkers, guerrilla historians, etc.
I was welcomed into this loose, Internet - based network of people who regularly explore urban ruins such as abandoned subway stations, tunnels, sewers, aqueducts, factories, hospitals, shipyards and so on.
When I took photographs in these locations, I felt there was something missing in the pictures.
Simply documenting these soon - to - be - demolished structures was n't enough for me.
So I wanted to create a fictional character or an animal that dwells in these underground spaces, and the simplest way to do it, at the time, was to model myself.
I decided against clothing because I wanted the figure to be without any cultural implications or time - specific elements.
I wanted a simple way to represent a living body inhabiting these decaying, derelict spaces.
This was taken in the Riviera Sugar Factory in Red Hook, Brooklyn.
It's now an empty, six - acre lot waiting for a shopping mall right across from the new Ikea.
I was very fond of this space because it's the first massive industrial complex I found on my own that is abandoned.
When I first went in, I was scared, because I heard dogs barking and I thought they were guard dogs.
But they happened to be wild dogs living there, and it was right by the water, so there were swans and ducks swimming around and trees growing everywhere and bees nesting in the sugar barrels.
The nature had really reclaimed the whole complex.
And, in a way, I wanted the human figure in the picture to become a part of that nature.
When I got comfortable in the space, it also felt like a big playground.
I would climb up the tanks and hop across exposed beams as if I went back in time and became a child again.
This was taken in the old Croton Aqueduct, which supplied fresh water to New York City for the first time.
The construction began in 1837.
It lasted about five years.
It got abandoned when the new Croton Aqueducts opened in 1890.
When you go into spaces like this, you're directly accessing the past, because they sit untouched for decades.
I love feeling the aura of a space that has so much history.
Instead of looking at reproductions of it at home, you're actually feeling the hand - laid bricks and shimmying up and down narrow cracks and getting wet and muddy and walking in a dark tunnel with a flashlight.
This is a tunnel underneath Riverside Park.
It was built in the 1930s by Robert Moses.
The murals were done by a graffiti artist to commemorate the hundreds of homeless people that got relocated from the tunnel in 1991 when the tunnel reopened for trains.
Walking in this tunnel is very peaceful.
There's nobody around you, and you hear the kids playing in the park above you, completely unaware of what's underneath.
When I was going out a lot to these places, I was feeling a lot of anxiety and isolation because I was in a solitary phase in my life, and I decided to title my series "Naked City Spleen," which references Charles Baudelaire.
"Naked City" is a nickname for New York, and "Spleen" embodies the melancholia and inertia that come from feeling alienated in an urban environment.
This is the same tunnel.
You see the sunbeams coming from the ventilation ducts and the train approaching.
This is a tunnel that's abandoned in Hell's Kitchen.
I was there alone, setting up, and a homeless man approached.
I was basically intruding in his living space.
I was really frightened at first, but I calmly explained to him that I was working on an art project and he did n't seem to mind and so I went ahead and put my camera on self - timer and ran back and forth.
And when I was done, he actually offered me his shirt to wipe off my feet and kindly walked me out.
It must have been a very unusual day for him.
(Laughter) One thing that struck me, after this incident, was that a space like that holds so many deleted memories of the city.
That homeless man, to me, really represented an element of the unconscious of the city.
He told me that he was abused above ground and was once in Riker's Island, and at last he found peace and quiet in that space.
The tunnel was once built for the prosperity of the city, but is now a sanctuary for outcasts, who are completely forgotten in the average urban dweller's everyday life.
This is underneath my alma mater, Columbia University.
The tunnels are famous for having been used during the development of the Manhattan Project.
This particular tunnel is interesting because it shows the original foundations of Bloomingdale Insane Asylum, which was demolished in 1890 when Columbia moved in.
This is the New York City Farm Colony, which was a poorhouse in Staten Island from the 1890s to the 1930s.
Most of my photos are set in places that have been abandoned for decades, but this is an exception.
This children's hospital was closed in 1997; it's located in Newark.
When I was there three years ago, the windows were broken and the walls were peeling, but everything was left there as it was.
You see the autopsy table, morgue trays, x - ray machines and even used utensils, which you see on the autopsy table.
After exploring recently - abandoned buildings, I felt that everything could fall into ruins very fast: your home, your office, a shopping mall, a church -- any man - made structures around you.
I was reminded of how fragile our sense of security is and how vulnerable people truly are.
I love to travel, and Berlin has become one of my favorite cities.
It's full of history, and also full of underground bunkers and ruins from the war.
This was taken under a homeless asylum built in 1885 to house 1,100 people.
I saw the structure while I was on the train, and I got off at the next station and met people there that gave me access to their catacomb - like basement, which was used for ammunition storage during the war and also, at some point, to hide groups of Jewish refugees.
This is the actual catacombs in Paris.
I explored there extensively in the off - limits areas and fell in love right away.
There are more than 185 miles of tunnels, and only about a mile is open to the public as a museum.
The first tunnels date back to 60 B.C.
They were consistently dug as limestone quarries and by the 18th century, the caving - in of some of these quarries posed safety threats, so the government ordered reinforcing of the existing quarries and dug new observation tunnels in order to monitor and map the whole place.
As you can see, the system is very complex and vast.
It's very dangerous to get lost in there.
And at the same time, there was a problem in the city with overflowing cemeteries.
So the bones were moved from the cemeteries into the quarries, making them into the catacombs.
The remains of over six million people are housed in there, some over 1,300 years old.
This was taken under the Montparnasse Cemetery where most of the ossuaries are located.
There are also phone cables that were used in the '50s and many bunkers from the World War II era.
This is a German bunker.
Nearby there's a French bunker, and the whole tunnel system is so complex that the two parties never met.
The tunnels are famous for having been used by the Resistance, which Victor Hugo wrote about in "Les Miserables."
And I saw a lot of graffiti from the 1800s, like this one.
After exploring the underground of Paris, I decided to climb up, and I climbed a Gothic monument that's right in the middle of Paris.
This is the Tower of Saint Jacques.
It was built in the early 1500s.
I do n't recommend sitting on a gargoyle in the middle of January, naked.
It was not very comfortable.
(Laughter) And all this time, I never saw a single rat in any of these places, until recently, when I was in the London sewers.
This was probably the toughest place to explore.
I had to wear a gas mask because of the toxic fumes -- I guess, except for in this picture.
And when the tides of waste matter come in it sounds as if a whole storm is approaching you.
This is a still from a film I worked on recently, called "Blind Door."
I've become more interested in capturing movement and texture.
And this is the first theater project I worked on.
I adapted and produced "A Dream Play" by August Strindberg.
It was performed last September one time only in the Atlantic Avenue tunnel in Brooklyn, which is considered to be the oldest underground train tunnel in the world, built in 1844.
I've been leaning towards more collaborative projects like these, lately.
But whenever I get a chance I still work on my series.
The last place I visited was the Mayan ruins of Copan, Honduras.
This was taken inside an archaeological tunnel in the main temple.
I like doing more than just exploring these spaces.
I feel an obligation to animate and humanize these spaces continually in order to preserve their memories in a creative way -- before they're lost forever.
(Guitar music starts) (Cheers) (Cheers) (Music ends)
For as far back as we can trace our existence, humans have been fascinated with death and resurrection.
Nearly every religion in the world has some interpretation of them, and from our earliest myths to the latest cinematic blockbusters, the dead keep coming back.
But is resurrection really possible?
And what is the actual difference between a living creature and a dead body, anyway?
To understand what death is, we need to understand what life is.
One ancient theory was an idea called vitalism, which claimed that living things were unique because they were filled with a special substance, or energy, that was the essence of life.
Whether it was called qi, lifeblood, or humors, the belief in such an essence was common throughout the world, and still persists in the stories of creatures who can somehow drain life from others, or some form of magical sources that can replenish it.
Vitalism began to fade in the Western world following the Scientific Revolution in the 17th century.
René Descartes advanced the notion that the human body was essentially no different from any other machine, brought to life by a divinely created soul located in the brain's pineal gland.
And in 1907, Dr. Duncan McDougall even claimed that the soul had mass, weighing patients immediately before and after death in an attempt to prove it.
Though his experiments were discredited, much like the rest of vitalism, traces of his theory still come up in popular culture.
But where do all these discredited theories leave us?
What we now know is that life is not contained in some magical substance or spark, but within the ongoing biological processes themselves.
And to understand these processes, we need to zoom down to the level of our individual cells.
Inside each of these cells, chemical reactions are constantly occurring, powered by the glucose and oxygen that our bodies convert into the energy - carrying molecule known as ATP.
Cells use this energy for everything from repair to growth to reproduction.
Not only does it take a lot of energy to make the necessary molecules, but it takes even more to get them where they need to be.
The universal phenomenon of entropy means that molecules will tend towards diffusing randomly, moving from areas of high concentration to low concentration, or even breaking apart into smaller molecules and atoms.
So cells must constantly keep entropy in check by using energy to maintain their molecules in the very complicated formations necessary for biological functions to occur.
The breaking down of these arrangements when the entire cell succumbs to entropy is what eventually results in death.
We can pump air into someone's lungs, but it wo n't do much good if the many other processes involved in the respiratory cycle are no longer functioning.
Similarly, the electric shock from a defibrillator does n't jump - start an inanimate heart, but resynchronizes the muscle cells in an abnormally beating heart so they regain their normal rhythm.
This can prevent a person from dying, but it wo n't raise a dead body, or a monster sewn together from dead bodies.
So it would seem that all our various medical miracles can delay or prevent death but not reverse it.
But that's not as simple as it sounds because constant advancements in technology and medicine have resulted in diagnoses such as coma, describing potentially reversible conditions, under which people would have previously been considered dead.
Some animals are known to extend their lifespans or survive extreme conditions by slowing down their biological processes to the point where they are virtually paused.
And research into cryonics hopes to achieve the same by freezing dying people and reviving them later when newer technology is able to help them.
See, if the cells are frozen, there's very little molecular movement, and diffusion practically stops.
Even if all of a person's cellular processes had already broken down, this could still conceivably be reversed by a swarm of nanobots, moving all the molecules back to their proper positions, and injecting all of the cells with ATP at the same time, presumably causing the body to simply pick up where it left off.
So if we think of life not as some magical spark, but a state of incredibly complex, self - perpetuating organization, death is just the process of increasing entropy that destroys this fragile balance.
And the point at which someone is completely dead turns out not to be a fixed constant, but simply a matter of how much of this entropy we're currently capable of reversing.

"Do n't talk to strangers."
You have heard that phrase uttered by your friends, family, schools and the media for decades.
It's a norm.
But it's a special kind of social norm, because it's a social norm that wants to tell us who we can relate to and who we should n't relate to.
"Do n't talk to strangers" says, "Stay from anyone who's not familiar to you.
Stick with the people you know.
Stick with people like you.
How appealing is that?
It's not really what we do, is it, when we're at our best?
When we're at our best, we reach out to people who are not like us, because when we do that, we learn from people who are not like us.
My phrase for this value of being with "not like us" is "strangeness," and my point is that in today's digitally intensive world, strangers are quite frankly not the point.
The point that we should be worried about is, how much strangeness are we getting?
Because our social relations are increasingly mediated by data, and data turns our social relations into digital relations, and that means that our digital relations now depend extraordinarily on technology to bring to them a sense of robustness, a sense of discovery, a sense of surprise and unpredictability.
Why not strangers?
Because strangers are part of a world of really rigid boundaries.
They belong to a world of people I know versus people I do n't know, and in the context of my digital relations, I'm already doing things with people I do n't know.
The question is n't whether or not I know you.
The question is, what can I do with you?
What can I learn with you?
What can we do together that benefits us both?
I spend a lot of time thinking about how the social landscape is changing, how new technologies create new constraints and new opportunities for people.
The most important changes facing us today have to do with data and what data is doing to shape the kinds of digital relations that will be possible for us in the future.
The economies of the future depend on that.
Our social lives in the future depend on that.
The threat to worry about is n't strangers.
The threat to worry about is whether or not we're getting our fair share of strangeness.
Now, 20th - century psychologists and sociologists were thinking about strangers, but they were n't thinking so dynamically about human relations, and they were thinking about strangers in the context of influencing practices.
Stanley Milgram from the '60s and' 70s, the creator of the small - world experiments, which became later popularized as six degrees of separation, made the point that any two arbitrarily selected people were likely connected from between five to seven intermediary steps.
His point was that strangers are out there.
We can reach them.
There are paths that enable us to reach them.
Mark Granovetter, Stanford sociologist, in 1973 in his seminal essay "The Strength of Weak Ties," made the point that these weak ties that are a part of our networks, these strangers, are actually more effective at diffusing information to us than are our strong ties, the people closest to us.
He makes an additional indictment of our strong ties when he says that these people who are so close to us, these strong ties in our lives, actually have a homogenizing effect on us.
They produce sameness.
My colleagues and I at Intel have spent the last few years looking at the ways in which digital platforms are reshaping our everyday lives, what kinds of new routines are possible.
We've been looking specifically at the kinds of digital platforms that have enabled us to take our possessions, those things that used to be very restricted to us and to our friends in our houses, and to make them available to people we do n't know.
Whether it's our clothes, whether it's our cars, whether it's our bikes, whether it's our books or music, we are able to take our possessions now and make them available to people we've never met.
And we concluded a very important insight, which was that as people's relationships to the things in their lives change, so do their relations with other people.
And yet recommendation system after recommendation system continues to miss the boat.
It continues to try to predict what I need based on some past characterization of who I am, of what I've already done.
Security technology after security technology continues to design data protection in terms of threats and attacks, keeping me locked into really rigid kinds of relations.
Categories like "friends" and "family" and "contacts" and "colleagues" do n't tell me anything about my actual relations.
A more effective way to think about my relations might be in terms of closeness and distance, where at any given point in time, with any single person, I am both close and distant from that individual, all as a function of what I need to do right now.
People are n't close or distant.
People are always a combination of the two, and that combination is constantly changing.
What if technologies could intervene to disrupt the balance of certain kinds of relationships?
What if technologies could intervene to help me find the person that I need right now?
Strangeness is that calibration of closeness and distance that enables me to find the people that I need right now, that enables me to find the sources of intimacy, of discovery, and of inspiration that I need right now.
Strangeness is not about meeting strangers.
It simply makes the point that we need to disrupt our zones of familiarity.
So jogging those zones of familiarity is one way to think about strangeness, and it's a problem faced not just by individuals today, but also by organizations, organizations that are trying to embrace massively new opportunities.
Whether you're a political party insisting to your detriment on a very rigid notion of who belongs and who does not, whether you're the government protecting social institutions like marriage and restricting access of those institutions to the few, whether you're a teenager in her bedroom who's trying to jostle her relations with her parents, strangeness is a way to think about how we pave the way to new kinds of relations.
We have to change the norms.
We have to change the norms in order to enable new kinds of technologies as a basis for new kinds of businesses.
What interesting questions lie ahead for us in this world of no strangers?
How might we think differently about our relations with people?
How might we think differently about our relations with distributed groups of people?
How might we think differently about our relations with technologies, things that effectively become social participants in their own right?
The range of digital relations is extraordinary.
In the context of this broad range of digital relations, safely seeking strangeness might very well be a new basis for that innovation.
Cholera was reported in Haiti for the first time in over 50 years last October.
There was no way to predict how far it would spread through water supplies and how bad the situation would get.
And not knowing where help was needed always ensured that help was in short supply in the areas that needed it most.
We've gotten good at predicting and preparing for storms before they take innocent lives and cause irreversible damage, but we still ca n't do that with water, and here's why.
Right now, if you want to test water in the field, you need a trained technician, expensive equipment like this, and you have to wait about a day for chemical reactions to take place and provide results.
It's too slow to get a picture of conditions on the ground before they change, too expensive to implement in all the places that require testing.
And it ignores the fact that, in the meanwhile, people still need to drink water.
Most of the information that we collected on the cholera outbreak did n't come from testing water; it came from forms like this, which documented all the people we failed to help.
Countless lives have been saved by canaries in coalmines -- a simple and invaluable way for miners to know whether they're safe.
I've been inspired by that simplicity as I've been working on this problem with some of the most hardworking and brilliant people I've ever known.
We think there's a simpler solution to this problem -- one that can be used by people who face conditions like this everyday.
It's in its early stages, but this is what it looks like right now.
We call it the Water Canary.
It's a fast, cheap device that answers an important question: Is this water contaminated?
It does n't require any special training.
And instead of waiting for chemical reactions to take place, it uses light.
That means there's no waiting for chemical reactions to take place, no need to use reagents that can run out and no need to be an expert to get actionable information.
To test water, you simply insert a sample and, within seconds, it either displays a red light, indicating contaminated water, or a green light, indicating the sample is safe.
This will make it possible for anyone to collect life - saving information and to monitor water quality conditions as they unfold.
We're also, on top of that, integrating wireless networking into an affordable device with GPS and GSM.
What that means is that each reading can be automatically transmitted to servers to be mapped in real time.
With enough users, maps like this will make it possible to take preventive action, containing hazards before they turn into emergencies that take years to recover from.
And then, instead of taking days to disseminate this information to the people who need it most, it can happen automatically.
We've seen how distributed networks, big data and information can transform society.
I think it's time for us to apply them to water.
Our goal over the next year is to get Water Canary ready for the field and to open - source the hardware so that anyone can contribute to the development and the evaluation, so we can tackle this problem together.
Thank you.
We are going to take a quick voyage over the cognitive history of the 20th century, because during that century, our minds have altered dramatically.
As you all know, the cars that people drove in 1900 have altered because the roads are better and because of technology.
And our minds have altered, too.
We've gone from people who confronted a concrete world and analyzed that world primarily in terms of how much it would benefit them to people who confront a very complex world, and it's a world where we've had to develop new mental habits, new habits of mind.
And these include things like clothing that concrete world with classification, introducing abstractions that we try to make logically consistent, and also taking the hypothetical seriously, that is, wondering about what might have been rather than what is.
Now, this dramatic change was drawn to my attention through massive I.Q. gains over time, and these have been truly massive.
That is, we do n't just get a few more questions right on I.Q. tests.
We get far more questions right on I.Q. tests than each succeeding generation back to the time that they were invented.
Indeed, if you score the people a century ago against modern norms, they would have an average I.Q. of 70.
If you score us against their norms, we would have an average I.Q. of 130.
Now this has raised all sorts of questions.
Were our immediate ancestors on the verge of mental retardation?
Because 70 is normally the score for mental retardation.
Or are we on the verge of all being gifted?
Because 130 is the cutting line for giftedness.
Now I'm going to try and argue for a third alternative that's much more illuminating than either of those, and to put this into perspective, let's imagine that a Martian came down to Earth and found a ruined civilization.
And this Martian was an archaeologist, and they found scores, target scores, that people had used for shooting.
And first they looked at 1865, and they found that in a minute, people had only put one bullet in the bullseye.
And then they found, in 1898, that they'd put about five bullets in the bullseye in a minute.
And then about 1918 they put a hundred bullets in the bullseye.
And initially, that archaeologist would be baffled.
They would say, look, these tests were designed to find out how much people were steady of hand, how keen their eyesight was, whether they had control of their weapon.
How could these performances have escalated to this enormous degree?
Well we now know, of course, the answer.
If that Martian looked at battlefields, they would find that people had only muskets at the time of the Civil War and that they had repeating rifles at the time of the Spanish - American War, and then they had machine guns by the time of World War I.
And, in other words, it was the equipment that was in the hands of the average soldier that was responsible, not greater keenness of eye or steadiness of hand.
Now what we have to imagine is the mental artillery that we have picked up over those hundred years, and I think again that another thinker will help us here, and that's Luria.
Luria looked at people just before they entered the scientific age, and he found that these people were resistant to classifying the concrete world.
They wanted to break it up into little bits that they could use.
He found that they were resistant to deducing the hypothetical, to speculating about what might be, and he found finally that they did n't deal well with abstractions or using logic on those abstractions.
Now let me give you a sample of some of his interviews.
He talked to the head man of a person in rural Russia.
They'd only had, as people had in 1900, about four years of schooling.
And he asked that particular person, what do crows and fish have in common?
You know, I can eat a fish.
I ca n't eat a crow.
A crow can peck at a fish.
A fish ca n't do anything to a crow.
And Luria said, "But are n't they both animals?"
And he said, Of course not.
One's a fish.
The other is a bird.
And he was interested, effectively, in what he could do with those concrete objects.
And then Luria went to another person, and he said to them, "There are no camels in Germany.
Hamburg is a city in Germany.
Are there camels in Hamburg?
And the fellow said, "Well, if it's large enough, there ought to be camels there."
And Luria said, "But what do my words imply?"
And he said, "Well, maybe it's a small village, and there's no room for camels."
In other words, he was unwilling to treat this as anything but a concrete problem, and he was used to camels being in villages, and he was quite unable to use the hypothetical, to ask himself what if there were no camels in Germany.
A third interview was conducted with someone about the North Pole.
And Luria said, "At the North Pole, there is always snow.
Wherever there is always snow, the bears are white.
What color are the bears at the North Pole?
And the response was, "Such a thing is to be settled by testimony.
If a wise person came from the North Pole and told me the bears were white, I might believe him, but every bear that I have seen is a brown bear.
Now you see again, this person has rejected going beyond the concrete world and analyzing it through everyday experience, and it was important to that person what color bears were -- that is, they had to hunt bears.
They were n't willing to engage in this.
One of them said to Luria, "How can we solve things that are n't real problems?
None of these problems are real.
How can we address them?
Now, these three categories -- classification, using logic on abstractions, taking the hypothetical seriously -- how much difference do they make in the real world beyond the testing room?
And let me give you a few illustrations.
First, almost all of us today get a high school diploma.
That is, we've gone from four to eight years of education to 12 years of formal education, and 52 percent of Americans have actually experienced some type of tertiary education.
Now, not only do we have much more education, and much of that education is scientific, and you ca n't do science without classifying the world.
You ca n't do science without proposing hypotheses.
You ca n't do science without making it logically consistent.
And even down in grade school, things have changed.
In 1910, they looked at the examinations that the state of Ohio gave to 14 - year - olds, and they found that they were all for socially valued concrete information.
They were things like, what are the capitals of the 44 or 45 states that existed at that time?
When they looked at the exams that the state of Ohio gave in 1990, they were all about abstractions.
They were things like, why is the largest city of a state rarely the capital?
And you were supposed to think, well, the state legislature was rural - controlled, and they hated the big city, so rather than putting the capital in a big city, they put it in a county seat.
They put it in Albany rather than New York.
They put it in Harrisburg rather than Philadelphia.
And so forth.
So the tenor of education has changed.
We are educating people to take the hypothetical seriously, to use abstractions, and to link them logically.
What about employment?
Well, in 1900, three percent of Americans practiced professions that were cognitively demanding.
Only three percent were lawyers or doctors or teachers.
Today, 35 percent of Americans practice cognitively demanding professions, not only to the professions proper like lawyer or doctor or scientist or lecturer, but many, many sub-professions having to do with being a technician, a computer programmer.
A whole range of professions now make cognitive demands.
And we can only meet the terms of employment in the modern world by being cognitively far more flexible.
And it's not just that we have many more people in cognitively demanding professions.
The professions have been upgraded.
Compare the doctor in 1900, who really had only a few tricks up his sleeve, with the modern general practitioner or specialist, with years of scientific training.
Compare the banker in 1900, who really just needed a good accountant and to know who was trustworthy in the local community for paying back their mortgage.
Well, the merchant bankers who brought the world to their knees may have been morally remiss, but they were cognitively very agile.
They went far beyond that 1900 banker.
They had to look at computer projections for the housing market.
They had to prepare a case to get rating agencies to give it a AAA, though in many cases, they had virtually bribed the rating agencies.
And they also, of course, had to get people to accept these so - called assets and pay money for them even though they were highly vulnerable.
Or take a farmer today.
I take the farm manager of today as very different from the farmer of 1900.
So it has n't just been the spread of cognitively demanding professions.
It's also been the upgrading of tasks like lawyer and doctor and what have you that have made demands on our cognitive faculties.
But I've talked about education and employment.
Some of the habits of mind that we have developed over the 20th century have paid off in unexpected areas.
I'm primarily a moral philosopher.
I merely have a holiday in psychology, and what interests me in general is moral debate.
Now over the last century, in developed nations like America, moral debate has escalated because we take the hypothetical seriously, and we also take universals seriously and look for logical connections.
My father was born in 1885, and he was mildly racially biased.
As an Irishman, he hated the English so much, he did n't have much emotion for anyone else.
(Laughter) But he did have a sense that black people were inferior.
they said that is the dumbest thing you've ever said.
Who have you ever known who woke up in the morning -- (Laughter) -- that turned black?
In other words, they were fixed in the concrete mores and attitudes they had inherited.
They would not take the hypothetical seriously, and without the hypothetical, it's very difficult to get moral argument off the ground.
You have to say, imagine you were in Iran, and imagine that your relatives all suffered from collateral damage even though they had done no wrong.
How would you feel about that?
And if someone of the older generation says, well, our government takes care of us, and it's up to their government to take care of them, they're just not willing to take the hypothetical seriously.
Or take an Islamic father whose daughter has been raped, and he feels he's honor - bound to kill her.
Well, he's treating his mores as if they were sticks and stones and rocks that he had inherited, and they're unmovable in any way by logic.
They're just inherited mores.
Today we would say something like, well, imagine you were knocked unconscious and sodomized.
Would you deserve to be killed?
And he would say, well that's not in the Koran.
That's not one of the principles I've got.
Well you, today, universalize your principles.
You state them as abstractions and you use logic on them.
If you have a principle such as, people should n't suffer unless they're guilty of something, then to exclude black people you've got to make exceptions, do n't you?
You have to say, well, blackness of skin, you could n't suffer just for that.
And then we can bring empirical evidence to bear, ca n't we, and say, well how can you consider all blacks tainted when St. Augustine was black and Thomas Sowell is black.
And you can get moral argument off the ground, then, because you're not treating moral principles as concrete entities.
You're treating them as universals, to be rendered consistent by logic.
Now how did all of this arise out of I.Q. tests?
That's what initially got me going on cognitive history.
If you look at the I.Q. test, you find the gains have been greatest in certain areas.
The similarities subtest of the Wechsler is about classification, and we have made enormous gains on that classification subtest.
There are other parts of the I.Q. test battery that are about using logic on abstractions.
Some of you may have taken Raven's Progressive Matrices, and it's all about analogies.
And in 1900, people could do simple analogies.
That is, if you said to them, cats are like wildcats.
What are dogs like?
They would say wolves.
But by 1960, people could attack Raven's on a much more sophisticated level.
If you said, we've got two squares followed by a triangle, what follows two circles?
They could say a semicircle.
Just as a triangle is half of a square, a semicircle is half of a circle.
By 2010, college graduates, if you said two circles followed by a semicircle, two sixteens followed by what, they would say eight, because eight is half of 16.
That is, they had moved so far from the concrete world that they could even ignore the appearance of the symbols that were involved in the question.
Now, I should say one thing that's very disheartening.
We have n't made progress on all fronts.
One of the ways in which we would like to deal with the sophistication of the modern world is through politics, and sadly you can have humane moral principles, you can classify, you can use logic on abstractions, and if you're ignorant of history and of other countries, you ca n't do politics.
We've noticed, in a trend among young Americans, that they read less history and less literature and less material about foreign lands, and they're essentially ahistorical.
They do n't know the Korean War from the war in Vietnam.
They do n't know who was an ally of America in World War II.
Think how different America would be if every American knew that this is the fifth time Western armies have gone to Afghanistan to put its house in order, and if they had some idea of exactly what had happened on those four previous occasions.
(Laughter) And that is, they had barely left, and there was n't a trace in the sand.
Or imagine how different things would be if most Americans knew that we had been lied into four of our last six wars.
You know, the Spanish did n't sink the battleship Maine, the Lusitania was not an innocent vessel but was loaded with munitions, the North Vietnamese did not attack the Seventh Fleet, and, of course, Saddam Hussein hated al Qaeda and had nothing to do with it, and yet the administration convinced 45 percent of the people that they were brothers in arms, when he would hang one from the nearest lamppost.
But I do n't want to end on a pessimistic note.
The 20th century has shown enormous cognitive reserves in ordinary people that we have now realized, and the aristocracy was convinced that the average person could n't make it, that they could never share their mindset or their cognitive abilities.
Lord Curzon once said he saw people bathing in the North Sea, and he said, "Why did no one tell me what white bodies the lower orders have?"
As if they were a reptile.
Well, Dickens was right and he was wrong.
Kipling said, "The colonel's lady and Judy O'Grady are sisters underneath the skin."
So, imagine that you had your smartphone miniaturized and hooked up directly to your brain.
If you had this sort of brain chip, you'd be able to upload and download to the internet at the speed of thought.
Accessing social media or Wikipedia would be a lot like -- well, from the inside at least -- like consulting your own memory.
It would be as easy and as intimate as thinking.
But would it make it easier for you to know what's true?
Just because a way of accessing information is faster it does n't mean it's more reliable, of course, and it does n't mean that we would all interpret it the same way.
And it does n't mean that you would be any better at evaluating it.
In fact, you might even be worse, because, you know, more data, less time for evaluation.
Something like this is already happening to us right now.
We already carry a world of information around in our pockets, but it seems as if the more information we share and access online, the more difficult it can be for us to tell the difference between what's real and what's fake.
It's as if we know more but understand less.
Now, it's a feature of modern life, I suppose, that large swaths of the public live in isolated information bubbles.
We're polarized: not just over values, but over the facts.
One reason for that is, the data analytics that drive the internet get us not just more information, but more of the information that we want.
Our online life is personalized; everything from the ads we read to the news that comes down our Facebook feed is tailored to satisfy our preferences.
And so while we get more information, a lot of that information ends up reflecting ourselves as much as it does reality.
It ends up, I suppose, inflating our bubbles rather than bursting them.
And so maybe it's no surprise that we're in a situation, a paradoxical situation, of thinking that we know so much more, and yet not agreeing on what it is we know.
So how are we going to solve this problem of knowledge polarization?
One obvious tactic is to try to fix our technology, to redesign our digital platforms, so as to make them less susceptible to polarization.
And I'm happy to report that many smart people at Google and Facebook are working on just that.
And these projects are vital.
I think that fixing technology is obviously really important, but I do n't think technology alone, fixing it, is going to solve the problem of knowledge polarization.
I do n't think that because I do n't think, at the end of the day, it is a technological problem.
I think it's a human problem, having to do with how we think and what we value.
In order to solve it, I think we're going to need help.
We're going to need help from psychology and political science.
Because to solve the problem of knowledge polarization, we're going to need to reconnect with one fundamental, philosophical idea: that we live in a common reality.
The idea of a common reality is like, I suppose, a lot of philosophical concepts: easy to state but mysteriously difficult to put into practice.
To really accept it, I think we need to do three things, each of which is a challenge right now.
First, we need to believe in truth.
You might have noticed that our culture is having something of a troubled relationship with that concept right now.
It seems as if we disagree so much that, as one political commentator put it not long ago, it's as if there are no facts anymore.
But that thought is actually an expression of a sort of seductive line of argument that's in the air.
It goes like this: we just ca n't step outside of our own perspectives; we ca n't step outside of our biases.
Every time we try, we just get more information from our perspective.
So, this line of thought goes, we might as well admit that objective truth is an illusion, or it does n't matter, because either we'll never know what it is, or it does n't exist in the first place.
That's not a new philosophical thought -- skepticism about truth.
During the end of the last century, as some of you know, it was very popular in certain academic circles.
But it really goes back all the way to the Greek philosopher Protagoras, if not farther back.
Protagoras said that objective truth was an illusion because "man is the measure of all things."
Man is the measure of all things.
That can seem like a bracing bit of realpolitik to people, or liberating, because it allows each of us to discover or make our own truth.
But actually, I think it's a bit of self - serving rationalization disguised as philosophy.
It confuses the difficulty of being certain with the impossibility of truth.
Look -- of course it's difficult to be certain about anything; we might all be living in "The Matrix."
You might have a brain chip in your head feeding you all the wrong information.
But in practice, we do agree on all sorts of facts.
We agree that bullets can kill people.
We agree that you ca n't flap your arms and fly.
We agree -- or we should -- that there is an external reality and ignoring it can get you hurt.
Nonetheless, skepticism about truth can be tempting, because it allows us to rationalize away our own biases.
When we do that, we're sort of like the guy in the movie who knew he was living in "The Matrix" but decided he liked it there, anyway.
After all, getting what you want feels good.
Being right all the time feels good.
So, often it's easier for us to wrap ourselves in our cozy information bubbles, live in bad faith, and take those bubbles as the measure of reality.
An example, I think, of how this bad faith gets into our action is our reaction to the phenomenon of fake news.
The fake news that spread on the internet during the American presidential election of 2016 was designed to feed into our biases, designed to inflate our bubbles.
But what was really striking about it was not just that it fooled so many people.
What was really striking to me about fake news, the phenomenon, is how quickly it itself became the subject of knowledge polarization; so much so, that the very term -- the very term -- "fake news" now just means: "news story I do n't like."
That's an example of the bad faith towards the truth that I'm talking about.
But the really, I think, dangerous thing about skepticism with regard to truth is that it leads to despotism.
"Man is the measure of all things" inevitably becomes "The Man is the measure of all things."
Just as "every man for himself" always seems to turn out to be "only the strong survive."
At the end of Orwell's "1984," the thought policeman O'Brien is torturing the protagonist Winston Smith into believing two plus two equals five.
What O'Brien says is the point, is that he wants to convince Smith that whatever the party says is the truth, and the truth is whatever the party says.
And what O'Brien knows is that once this thought is accepted, critical dissent is impossible.
You ca n't speak truth to power if the power speaks truth by definition.
I said that in order to accept that we really live in a common reality, we have to do three things.
The first thing is to believe in truth.
The second thing can be summed up by the Latin phrase that Kant took as the motto for the Enlightenment: "Sapere aude," or "dare to know."
Or as Kant wants, "to dare to know for yourself."
I think in the early days of the internet, a lot of us thought that information technology was always going to make it easier for us to know for ourselves, and of course in many ways, it has.
But as the internet has become more and more a part of our lives, our reliance on it, our use of it, has become often more passive.
Much of what we know today we Google - know.
We download prepackaged sets of facts and sort of shuffle them along the assembly line of social media.
Now, Google - knowing is useful precisely because it involves a sort of intellectual outsourcing.
We offload our effort onto a network of others and algorithms.
And that allows us, of course, to not clutter our minds with all sorts of facts.
We can just download them when we need them.
And that's awesome .1111111
But there's a difference between downloading a set of facts and really understanding how or why those facts are as they are.
Understanding why a particular disease spreads, or how a mathematical proof works, or why your friend is depressed, involves more than just downloading.
It's going to require, most likely, doing some work for yourself: having a little creative insight; using your imagination; getting out into the field; doing the experiment; working through the proof; talking to someone.
Now, I'm not saying, of course, that we should stop Google - knowing.
I'm just saying we should n't overvalue it, either.
We need to find ways of encouraging forms of knowing that are more active, and do n't always involve passing off our effort into our bubble.
Because the thing about Google - knowing is that too often it ends up being bubble - knowing.
And bubble - knowing means always being right.
But daring to know, daring to understand, means risking the possibility that you could be wrong.
It means risking the possibility that what you want and what's true are different things.
Which brings me to the third thing that I think we need to do if we want to accept that we live in a common reality.
That third thing is: have a little humility.
By humility here, I mean epistemic humility, which means, in a sense, knowing that you do n't know it all.
But it also means something more than that.
It means seeing your worldview as open to improvement by the evidence and experience of others.
Seeing your worldview as open to improvement by the evidence and experience of others.
It's more than just being open to self - improvement.
It means seeing your knowledge as capable of enhancing or being enriched by what others contribute.
That's part of what is involved in recognizing there's a common reality that you, too, are responsible to.
I do n't think it's much of a stretch to say that our society is not particularly great at enhancing or encouraging that sort of humility.
That's partly because, well, we tend to confuse arrogance and confidence.
And it's partly because, well, you know, arrogance is just easier.
It's just easier to think of yourself as knowing it all.
It's just easier to think of yourself as having it all figured out.
But that's another example of the bad faith towards the truth that I've been talking about.
So the concept of a common reality, like a lot of philosophical concepts, can seem so obvious, that we can look right past it and forget why it's important.
Democracies ca n't function if their citizens do n't strive, at least some of the time, to inhabit a common space, a space where they can pass ideas back and forth when -- and especially when -- they disagree.
But you ca n't strive to inhabit that space if you do n't already accept that you live in the same reality.
To accept that, we've got to believe in truth, we've got to encourage more active ways of knowing.
And we've got to have the humility to realize that we're not the measure of all things.
We may yet one day realize the vision of having the internet in our brains.
But if we want that to be liberating and not terrifying, if we want it to expand our understanding and not just our passive knowing, we need to remember that our perspectives, as wondrous, as beautiful as they are, are just that -- perspectives on one reality.
I would like to tell you about a project which I started about 16 years ago.
It's about making new forms of life.
And these are made of this kind of tube -- electricity tube, we call it in Holland.
And we can start a film about that, and we can see a little bit backwards in time.
Narrator: Eventually, these beasts are going to live in herds on the beaches.
Theo Jansen is working hard on this evolution.
Theo Jansen: I want to put these forms of life on the beaches.
And they should survive over there, on their own, in the future.
Learning to live on their own -- and it'll take couple of more years to let them walk on their own.
Narrator: The mechanical beasts will not get their energy from food, but from the wind.
The wind will move feathers on their back, which will drive their feet.
The beast walks sideways on the wet sand of the beach, with it s nose pointed into the wind.
As soon as it walks into either the rolling surf or the dry sand, it stops, and walks in the opposite direction.
Evolution has generated many species.
This is a herd, and it is built according to genetic codes.
And it is a sort of race, and each and every animal is different, and the winning codes will multiply.
This is the wave, going from left to right. You can see this one.
Yes, and now it goes from left to right.
This is a new generation, a new family, which is able to store the wind.
So, the wings pump up air in lemonade bottles, which are on top of that.
And they can use that energy in case the wind falls away, and the tide is coming up, and there is still a little bit of energy to reach the dunes and save their lives, because they are drowned very easily.
(Laughter) I could show you this animal.
So, the proportion of the tubes in this animal is very important for the walking.
There are 11 numbers, which I call The 11 Holy Numbers.
These are the distances of the tubes which make it walk that way.
In fact, it's a new invention of the wheel.
It works the same as a wheel.
The axis of a wheel stays on the same level, and this hip is staying on the same level as well.
In fact, this is better than a wheel, because when you try to drive your bicycle on the beach, you will notice it's very hard to do.
And the feet just step over the sand, and the wheel has to touch every piece of the ground in - between.
So 5,000 years after the invention of the wheel, we have a new wheel.
I will show you, in the next video -- can you start it, please? -- that very heavy loads can be moved.
There's a guy pushing there, behind, but it can also walk on the wind very well.
It's 3.2 tons.
This is working on the stored wind in the bottles.
It has a feeler, where it can feel obstacles and turn around.
You see, it's going the other way.
Can I have the feeler here?
So, they have to survive all the dangers of the beach, and one of the big dangers is the sea.
This is the sea.
And it must feel the water of the sea.
And this is the water feeler, and what's very important is this tube.
It sucks in air normally, but when it swallows water, it feels the resistance of it.
So, imagine that the animal is walking towards the sea.
As soon as it touches the water, you should hear a sound of running air.
So if it does n't feel, it will be drowned, OK?
Here we have the brain of the animal.
In fact, it is a step counter, and it counts the steps.
It's a binary step counter.
So as soon it has been to the sea, it changes the pattern of zeroes and ones here.
And it always knows where it is on the beach.
So it's very simple brain.
It says, well, there's the sea, there are dunes, and I'm here.
So it's a sort of imagination of the simple world of the beach animal.
Thank you.
One of the biggest enemies are the storms.
This is a part of the nose of the Animaris Percipiere.
When the nose of the animal is fixed, the whole animal is fixed.
So when the storm is coming up, it drives a pin into the ground.
The nose is fixed, the whole animal is fixed.
The wind may turn, but the animal will always turn it s nose into the wind.
Now, another couple of years, and these animals will survive on their own.
I still have to help them a lot.
I'm a physician trained in infectious diseases, and following my training, I moved to Somalia from San Francisco.
And my goodbye greeting from the chief of infectious diseases at San Francisco General was, "Gary, this is the biggest mistake you'll ever make."
But I landed in a refugee situation that had a million refugees in 40 camps, and there were six of us doctors.
There were many epidemics there.
My responsibilities were largely related to tuberculosis, and then we got struck by an epidemic of cholera.
So it was the spread of tuberculosis and the spread of cholera that I was responsible for inhibiting.
And in order to do this work, we, of course, because of the limitation in health workers, had to recruit refugees to be a specialized new category of health worker.
Following three years of work in Somalia, I got picked up by the World Health Organization, and got assigned to the epidemics of AIDS.
My primary responsibility was Uganda, but also I worked in Rwanda and Burundi and Zaire, now Congo, Tanzania, Malawi, and several other countries.
And my last assignment there was to run a unit called intervention development, which was responsible for designing interventions.
After 10 years of working overseas, I was exhausted.
I really had very little left.
I had been traveling to one country after another.
I was emotionally feeling very isolated.
I wanted to come home.
I'd seen a lot of death, in particular epidemic death, and epidemic death has a different feel to it.
It's full of panic and fear, and I'd heard the women wailing and crying in the desert.
And I wanted to come home and take a break and maybe start over.
I was not aware of any epidemic problems in America.
In fact, I was n't aware of any problems in America.
In fact -- seriously.
And in fact I would visit friends of mine, and I noticed that they had water that came right into their homes.
How many of you have such a situation?
(Laughter) And some of them, many of them actually, had water that came into more than one room.
And I noticed that they would move this little thermoregulatory device to change the temperature in their home by one degree or two degrees.
And now I do that.
And I really did n't know what I would do, but friends of mine began telling me about children shooting other children with guns.
And I asked the question, what are you doing about it?
What are you in America doing about it?
And there were two essential explanations or ideas that were prevalent.
And one was punishment.
And this I had heard about before.
We who had worked in behavior knew that punishment was something that was discussed but also that it was highly overvalued.
It was not a main driver of behavior, nor was it a main driver of behavior change.
And besides that, it reminded me of ancient epidemics that were previously completely misunderstood because the science had n't been there before, epidemics of plague or typhus or leprosy, where the prevalent ideas were that there were bad people or bad humors or bad air, and widows were dragged around the moat, and dungeons were part of the solution.
The other explanation or, in a way, the solution suggested, is please fix all of these things: the schools, the community, the homes, the families, everything.
And I'd heard this before as well.
I'd called this the "everything" theory, or EOE: Everything On Earth.
But we'd also realized in treating other processes and problems that sometimes you do n't need to treat everything.
And so the sense that I had was there was a giant gap here.
The problem of violence was stuck, and this has historically been the case in many other issues.
Diarrheal diseases had been stuck.
Malaria had been stuck.
Frequently, a strategy has to be rethought.
It's not as if I had any idea what it would look like, but there was a sense that we would have to do something with new categories of workers and something having to do with behavior change and something having to do with public education.
But I began to ask questions and search out the usual things that I had been exploring before, like, what do the maps look like?
What do the graphs look like?
And the maps of violence in most U.S. cities looked like this.
There was clustering.
This reminded me of clustering that we'd seen also in infectious epidemics, for example cholera.
And then we looked at the maps, and the maps showed this typical wave upon wave upon wave, because all epidemics are combinations of many epidemics.
And it also looked like infectious epidemics.
And then we asked the question, well what really predicts a case of violence?
And it turns out that the greatest predictor of a case of violence is a preceding case of violence.
Which also sounds like, if there is a case of flu, someone gave someone a case of flu, or a cold, or the greatest risk factor of tuberculosis is having been exposed to tuberculosis.
And so we see that violence is, in a way, behaving like a contagious disease.
We're aware of this anyway even in our common experiences or our newspaper stories of the spread of violence from fights or in gang wars or in civil wars or even in genocides.
And so there's good news about this, though, because there's a way to reverse epidemics, and there's really only three things that are done to reverse epidemics, and the first of it is interrupting transmission.
In order to interrupt transmission, you need to detect and find first cases.
In other words, for T.B. you have to find somebody who has active T.B. who is infecting other people.
Make sense?
And there's special workers for doing that.
For this particular problem, we designed a new category of worker who, like a SARS worker or someone looking for bird flu, might find first cases.
In this case, it's someone who's very angry because someone looked at his girlfriend or owes him money, and you can find workers and train them into these specialized categories.
And the second thing to do, of course, is to prevent further spread, that means to find who else has been exposed, but may not be spreading so much right now like someone with a smaller case of T.B., or someone who is just hanging out in the neighborhoods, but in the same group, and then they need to be, in a way, managed as well, particular to the specific disease process.
And then the third part, the shifting the norms, and that means a whole bunch of community activities, remodeling, public education, and then you've got what you might call group immunity.
And that combination of factors is how the AIDS epidemic in Uganda was very successfully reversed.
And so what we decided to do in the year 2000 is kind of put this together in a way by hiring in new categories of workers, the first being violence interruptors.
And then we would put all of this into place in one neighborhood in what was the worst police district in the United States at the time.
So violence interruptors hired from the same group, credibility, trust, access, just like the health workers in Somalia, but designed for a different category, and trained in persuasion, cooling people down, buying time, reframing.
And then another category of worker, the outreach workers, to keep people in a way on therapy for six to 24 months.
Just like T.B., but the object is behavior change.
And then a bunch of community activities for changing norms.
Now our first experiment of this resulted in a 67 - percent drop in shootings and killings in the West Garfield neighborhood of Chicago.
(Applause) And this was a beautiful thing for the neighborhood itself, first 50 or 60 days, then 90 days, and then there was unfortunately another shooting in another 90 days, and the moms were hanging out in the afternoon.
They were using parks they were n't using before.
Everybody was happy.
But of course, the funders said, "Wait a second, do it again."
And so we had to then, fortunately, get the funds to repeat this experience, and this is one of the next four neighborhoods that had a 45 - percent drop in shootings and killings.
And since that time, this has been replicated 20 times.
There have been independent evaluations supported by the Justice Department and by the CDC and performed by Johns Hopkins that have shown 30 - to - 50 - percent and 40 - to - 70 - percent reductions in shootings and killings using this new method.
In fact, there have been three independent evaluations of this now.
Now we've gotten a lot of attention as a result of this, including being featured on The New York Times' Sunday magazine cover story.
The Economist in 2009 said this is "the approach that will come to prominence."
And even a movie was made around our work.
[The Interrupters] However, not so fast, because a lot of people did not agree with this way of going about it.
We got a lot of criticism, a lot of opposition, and a lot of opponents.
In other words, what do you mean, health problem?
What do you mean, epidemic?
What do you mean, no bad guys?
And there's whole industries designed for managing bad people.
What do you mean, hiring people who have backgrounds?
My business friends said, "Gary, you're being criticized tremendously.
You must be doing something right. "
(Laughter) My musician friends added the word "dude."
So anyway, additionally, there was still this problem, and we were getting highly criticized as well for not dealing with all of these other problems.
Yet we were able to manage malaria and reduce HIV and reduce diarrheal diseases in places with awful economies without healing the economy.
So what's actually happened is, although there is still some opposition, the movement is clearly growing.
Many of the major cities in the U.S., including New York City and Baltimore and Kansas City, their health departments are running this now.
Chicago and New Orleans, the health departments are having a very large role in this.
This is being embraced more by law enforcement than it had been years ago.
Trauma centers and hospitals are doing their part in stepping up.
And the U.S. Conference of Mayors has endorsed not only the approach but the specific model.
Where there's really been uptake even faster is in the international environment, where there's a 55 - percent drop in the first neighborhood in Puerto Rico, where interruptions are just beginning in Honduras, where the strategy has been applied in Kenya for the recent elections, and where there have been 500 interruptions in Iraq.
So violence is responding as a disease even as it behaves as a disease.
So the theory, in a way, is kind of being validated by the treatment.
And recently, the Institute of Medicine came out with a workshop report which went through some of the data, including the neuroscience, on how this problem is really transmitted.
So I think this is good news, because it allows us an opportunity to come out of the Middle Ages, which is where I feel this field has been.
It gives us an opportunity to consider the possibility of replacing some of these prisons with playgrounds or parks, and to consider the possibility of converting our neighborhoods into neighborhoods, and to allow there to be a new strategy, a new set of methods, a new set of workers: science, in a way, replacing morality.
And moving away from emotions is the most important part of the solution to science as a more important part of the solution.
So I did n't mean to come up with this at all.
It was a matter of, I wanted actually a break, and we looked at maps, we looked at graphs, we asked some questions and tried some tools that actually have been used many times before for other things.
For myself, I tried to get away from infectious diseases, and I did n't.
For more than 100 years, the telephone companies have provided wiretapping assistance to governments.
For much of this time, this assistance was manual.
Surveillance took place manually and wires were connected by hand.
Calls were recorded to tape.
But as in so many other industries, computing has changed everything.
The telephone companies built surveillance features into the very core of their networks.
I want that to sink in for a second: Our telephones and the networks that carry our calls were wired for surveillance first.
First and foremost.
So what that means is that when you're talking to your spouse, your children, a colleague or your doctor on the telephone, someone could be listening.
Now, that someone might be your own government; it could also be another government, a foreign intelligence service, or a hacker, or a criminal, or a stalker or any other party that breaks into the surveillance system, that hacks into the surveillance system of the telephone companies.
But while the telephone companies have built surveillance as a priority, Silicon Valley companies have not.
And increasingly, over the last couple years, Silicon Valley companies have built strong encryption technology into their communications products that makes surveillance extremely difficult.
For example, many of you might have an iPhone, and if you use an iPhone to send a text message to other people who have an iPhone, those text messages can not easily be wiretapped.
And in fact, according to Apple, they're not able to even see the text messages themselves.
Likewise, if you use FaceTime to make an audio call or a video call with one of your friends or loved ones, that, too, can not be easily wiretapped.
What sApp, which is now owned by Facebook and used by hundreds of millions of people around the world, also has built strong encryption technology into its product, which means that people in the Global South can easily communicate without their governments, often authoritarian, wiretapping their text messages.
So, after 100 years of being able to listen to any telephone call, anytime, anywhere, you might imagine that government officials are not very happy.
And in fact, that's what's happening.
Government officials are extremely mad.
And they're not mad because these encryption tools are now available.
What upsets them the most is that the tech companies have built encryption features into their products and turned them on by default.
It's the default piece that matters.
In short, the tech companies have democratized encryption.
And so, government officials like British Prime Minister David Cameron, they believe that all communications -- emails, texts, voice calls -- all of these should be available to governments, and encryption is making that difficult.
We live in a dangerous time in a dangerous world, and there really are bad people out there.
There are terrorists and other serious national security threats that I suspect we all want the FBI and the NSA to monitor.
But those surveillance features come at a cost.
The reason for that is that there is no such thing as a terrorist laptop, or a drug dealer's cell phone.
We all use the same communications devices.
What that means is that if the drug dealers' telephone calls or the terrorists' telephone calls can be intercepted, then so can the rest of ours, too.
And I think we really need to ask: Should a billion people around the world be using devices that are wiretap friendly?
So the scenario of hacking of surveillance systems that I've described -- this is not imaginary.
In 2009, the surveillance systems that Google and Microsoft built into their networks -- the systems that they use to respond to lawful surveillance requests from the police -- those systems were compromised by the Chinese government, because the Chinese government wanted to figure out which of their own agents the US government was monitoring.
By the same token, in 2004, the surveillance system built into the network of Vodafone Greece -- Greece's largest telephone company -- was compromised by an unknown entity, and that feature, the surveillance feature, was used to wiretap the Greek Prime Minister and members of the Greek cabinet.
The foreign government or hackers who did that were never caught.
And really, this gets to the very problem with these surveillance features, or backdoors.
When you build a backdoor into a communications network or piece of technology, you have no way of controlling who's going to go through it.
You have no way of controlling whether it'll be used by your side or the other side, by good guys, or by bad guys.
And so for that reason, I think that it's better to build networks to be as secure as possible.
Yes, this means that in the future, encryption is going to make wiretapping more difficult.
It means that the police are going to have a tougher time catching bad guys.
But the alternative would mean to live in a world where anyone's calls or anyone's text messages could be surveilled by criminals, by stalkers and by foreign intelligence agencies.
And I do n't want to live in that kind of world.
And so right now, you probably have the tools to thwart many kinds of government surveillance already on your phones and already in your pockets, you just might not realize how strong and how secure those tools are, or how weak the other ways you've used to communicate really are.
And so, my message to you is this: We need to use these tools.
We need to secure our telephone calls.
We need to secure our text messages.
I want you to use these tools.
I want you to tell your loved ones, I want you to tell your colleagues: Use these encrypted communications tools.
Do n't just use them because they're cheap and easy, but use them because they're secure.
Imagine that you are a product designer.
And you've designed a product, a new type of product, called the human immune system.
You're pitching this product to a skeptical, strictly no - nonsense manager.
Let's call him Bob.
I think we all know at least one Bob, right?
How would that go?
Bob, I've got this incredible idea for a completely new type of personal health product.
It's called the human immune system.
I can see from your face that you're having some problems with this.
Do n't worry.
I know it's very complicated.
I do n't want to take you through the gory details, I just want to tell you about some of the amazing features of this product.
First of all, it cleverly uses redundancy by having millions of copies of each component -- leukocytes, white blood cells -- before they're actually needed, to create a massive buffer against the unexpected.
And it cleverly leverages diversity by having not just leukocytes but B cells, T cells, natural killer cells, antibodies.
The components do n't really matter.
The point is that together, this diversity of different approaches can cope with more or less anything that evolution has been able to throw up.
And the design is completely modular.
You have the surface barrier of the human skin, you have the very rapidly reacting innate immune system and then you have the highly targeted adaptive immune system.
The point is, that if one system fails, another can take over, creating a virtually foolproof system.
I can see I'm losing you, Bob, but stay with me, because here is the really killer feature.
The product is completely adaptive.
It's able to actually develop targeted antibodies to threats that it's never even met before.
It actually also does this with incredible prudence, detecting and reacting to every tiny threat, and furthermore, remembering every previous threat, in case they are ever encountered again.
What I'm pitching you today is actually not a stand - alone product.
The product is embedded in the larger system of the human body, and it works in complete harmony with that system, to create this unprecedented level of biological protection.
So Bob, just tell me honestly, what do you think of my product?
And Bob may say something like, I sincerely appreciate the effort and passion that have gone into your presentation, blah blah blah -- (Laughter) But honestly, it's total nonsense.
You seem to be saying that the key selling points of your product are that it is inefficient and complex.
Did n't they teach you 80 - 20?
And furthermore, you're saying that this product is siloed.
It overreacts, makes things up as it goes along and is actually designed for somebody else's benefit.
I'm sorry to break it to you, but I do n't think this one is a winner.
And efficiency is always important in the short term.
Less complex, more efficient, more bang for the buck.
Who could say no to that?
Unfortunately, there's one very tiny problem, and that is that the user of this product, you or I, would probably die within one week of the next winter, when we encountered a new strain of the influenza virus.
I first became interested in biology and business, and longevity and resilience, when I was asked a very unusual question by the CEO of a global tech company.
And the question was: What do we have to do to make sure that our company lasts 100 years?
A seemingly innocent question, but actually, it's a little trickier than you might think, considering that the average US public company now can expect a life span of only 30 years.
That is less than half of the life span that it s employees can expect to enjoy.
Now, if you were the CEO of such a company, badgered by investors and buffeted by change, we might forgive you for not even worrying too much about what happens 30 years out.
But here's something that should keep you awake at night: the probability that your company will not be around in five year's time, on average, is now a staggering 32 percent.
That's a one in three chance that your company will be taken over or will fail within just five years.
Let's come back to our tech CEO's question.
Where better to turn for advice than nature, that's been in the business of life and death for longer than any company?
As a lapsed biologist, I decided to immediately call a real biologist, my friend Simon Levin, Professor of Biology and Mathematics at Princeton University.
Together, we looked at a variety of biological systems, ranging from natural tropical rainforests through to managed forests and fisheries.
And we asked ourselves the question: What makes these systems resilient and enduring?
And what we found was that the same six principles that we saw underpinning the miracle of the human immune system actually cropped up again and again, from redundancy through to embeddedness.
In fact, we saw these principles not only in biologically enduring systems, we also found them being very characteristic of long - lived social systems, like the Roman Empire and the Catholic Church, believe it or not.
We also went on to look at business, and found that these very same properties also characterized businesses that were resilient and long - lived, and we noted their absence from ones which were short - lived.
Let's first take a look at what happens when the corporate immune system collapses.
This beautiful building is part of the Shitennoji Temple Complex in Osaka, Japan.
In fact, it's one of the oldest temples in Japan.
It was built by a Korean artisan, because at the time, Japan was not yet building temples.
And this Korean artisan went on to found a temple - building company.
Amazingly, his company, Kongō Gumi, was still around 1,428 years later.
In fact, it became the oldest continuously operating company in the world.
So how is Kongō Gumi doing today?
Not too well, I'm afraid.
It borrowed very heavily during the bubble period of the Japanese economy, to invest in real estate.
And when the bubble burst, it could n't refinance its loans.
The company failed, and it was taken over by a major construction company.
Tragically, after 40 generations of very careful stewardship by the Kongō family, Kongō Gumi succumbed to a spectacular lapse in the ability to apply a principle of prudence.
Speaking of company failures: we're all familiar with the failure of Kodak, the company that declared bankruptcy in January 2012.
Much more interesting, however, is the question: Why did Fujifilm -- same product, same pressures from digital technology, same time -- why was Fujifilm able to survive and flourish?
Fujifilm used its capabilities in chemistry, material science and optics to diversify into a number of areas, ranging from cosmetics to pharmaceuticals, to medical systems to biomaterials.
Some of these diversification attempts failed.
But in aggregate, it was able to adapt its portfolio sufficiently to survive and flourish.
As the CEO, Mr. Komori, put it, the strategy succeeded because it had "more pockets and drawers" than the rivals.
He meant, of course, that they were able to create more options than the rivals.
Fujifilm survived because it applied the principles of prudence, diversity and adaptation.
A catastrophic factory fire, like the one we see here, completely wiped out, in one evening, the only plant which supplied Toyota with valves for car - braking systems.
The ultimate test of resilience.
Car production ground to a screeching halt.
How was it, then, that Toyota was able to recover car production?
Can you imagine how long it took?
Just five days.
From having no braking valves to complete recovery in five days.
How was this possible?
Toyota managed its network of suppliers in such a collaborative manner that it could work very quickly and smoothly with suppliers to repurpose production, fill the missing braking valve capacity and have car production come online again.
Toyota applied the principles of modularity of its supply network, embeddedness in an integrated system and the functional redundancy to be able to repurpose, smoothly, existing capacity.
Now fortunately, few companies succumb to catastrophic fires.
But we do read in the newspaper every day about companies succumbing to the disruption of technology.
How is it, then, that the consumer optics giant Essilor is able to avoid technology disruption, and even profit from it?
And yes, technology disruption is not only a big deal in software and electronics.
﻿Essilor carefully scans the competitive environment for potentially disruptive technologies.
It acquires those technologies very early, before they've become expensive or competitors have mobilized around them, and it then develops those technologies itself, even at the risk of failure or the risk of self - disruption.
Essilor stays ahead of its game, and has delivered spectacular performance for over 40 years, by using the principles of prudence and adaptation.
OK, if these principles are so powerful, you might be thinking, why are they not commonplace in business?
Why do we not use these words every day?
Well, change has to first start in the mind.
If we think back to our pitch to Bob, in order to apply the principles that underpin the miracle of the human immune system, we first need to think differently about business.
Now typically, when we think about business, we use what I call "mechanical thinking."
We set goals, we analyze problems, we construct and we adhere to plans, and more than anything else, we stress efficiency and short - term performance.
Now, do n't get me wrong - this is a splendidly practical and effective way of addressing relatively simple challenges in relatively stable environments.
It's the way that Bob -- and probably many of us, myself included -- process most business problems we're faced with every day.
In fact, it was a pretty good mental model for business -- overall -- until about the mid-1980s, when the conjunction of globalization and a revolution in technology and telecommunications made business far more dynamic and unpredictable.
But what about those more dynamic and unpredictable situations that we now increasingly face?
I think in addition to the mechanical thinking, we now need to master the art of biological thinking, as embodied by our six principles.
In other words, we need to think more modestly and subtly about when and how we can shape, rather than control, unpredictable and complex situations.
It's a little like the difference between throwing a ball and releasing a bird.
The ball would head in a straight line, probably towards the intended target, and the bird certainly would not.
So what do you think?
Sounds a little impractical, a little theoretical, perhaps?
Not at all.
Every small entrepreneurial company naturally thinks and acts biologically.
Because it lacks the resources to shape its environment through brute force.
It lacks the scale to buffer change, and it's constantly thinking about the tough odds for a start - up to survive.
Now, the irony is, of course, that every large company started off as a small, entrepreneurial company.
But along the way somewhere, many have lost this ability to think and act biologically.
They need to rejuvenate their ability to think biologically in order to survive and thrive in today's environment.
Every company I know spends plenty of time thinking about the central question of strategy: How good is our competitive game?
In addition, let's also consider the second, more biological and equally important question: How long will that game last?
(Music) Dannielle Hadley: Life in Pennsylvania means just that: life without the possibility of parole.
For us lifers, as we call ourselves, our only chance for release is through commutation, which has only been granted to two women since 1989, close to 30 years ago.

I'm not saying that I'm not guilty, I'm not saying that I should n't pay.
All I'm asking is for forgiveness.
Got ta have hope I'll be free someday.
Is there a place for me in the world out there?
Will they ever know or care that I'm chained?
Is there redemption for the sin of my younger days?
Because I've changed.
Lord knows I've changed.
Will I see my family or die alone?

Over the last two decades, India has become a global hub for software development and offshoring of back office services, as we call it, and what we were interested in finding out was that because of this huge industry that has started over the last two decades in India, offshoring software development and back office services, there's been a flight of white collar jobs from the developed world to India.
When this is combined with the loss of manufacturing jobs to China, it has, you know, led to considerable angst amongst the Western populations.
In fact, if you look at polls, they show a declining trend for support for free trade in the West.
Now, the Western elites, however, have said this fear is misplaced.
For example, if you have read - I suspect many of you have done so - read the book by Thomas Friedman called "The World Is Flat," he said, basically, in his book that, you know, this fear for free trade is wrong because it assumes, it's based on a mistaken assumption that everything that can be invented has been invented.
In fact, he says, it's innovation that will keep the West ahead of the developing world, with the more sophisticated, innovative tasks being done in the developed world, and the less sophisticated, shall we say, drudge work being done in the developing world.
Now, what we were trying to understand was, is this true?
Could India become a source, or a global hub, of innovation, just like it's become a global hub for back office services and software development?
And for the last four years, my coauthor Phanish Puranam and I spent investigating this topic.
Initially, or, you know, as people would say, you know, in fact the more aggressive people who are supporting the Western innovative model, say, "Where are the Indian Googles, iPods and Viagras, if the Indians are so bloody smart?"
(Laughter) So initially, when we started our research, we went and met several executives, and we asked them, What do you think?
Will India go from being a favored destination for software services and back office services to a destination for innovation?
They laughed.
They dismissed us.
They said, You know what?
Indians do n't do innovation.
The more polite ones said, "Well, you know, Indians make good software programmers and accountants, but they ca n't do the creative stuff."
Sometimes, it took a more, took a veneer of sophistication, and people said, "You know, it's nothing to do with Indians."
It's really the rule - based, regimented education system in India that is responsible for killing all creativity.
They said, instead, if you want to see real creativity, go to Silicon Valley, and look at companies like Google, Microsoft, Intel.
So we started examining the R&D and innovation labs of Silicon Valley.
Well, interestingly, what you find there is, usually you are introduced to the head of the innovation lab or the R&D center as they may call it, and more often than not, it's an Indian.
(Laughter) So I immediately said, "Well, but you could not have been educated in India, right?"
You must have gotten your education here.
It turned out, in every single case, they came out of the Indian educational system.
So we realized that maybe we had the wrong question, and the right question is, really, can Indians based out of India do innovative work?
So off we went to India.
We made, I think, about a dozen trips to Bangalore, Mumbai, Gurgaon, Delhi, Hyderabad, you name it, to examine what is the level of corporate innovation in these cities.
And what we found was, as we progressed in our research, was, that we were asking really the wrong question.
When you ask, "Where are the Indian Googles, iPods and Viagras?" you are taking a particular perspective on innovation, which is innovation for end users, visible innovation.
Instead, innovation, if you remember, some of you may have read the famous economist Schumpeter, he said, "Innovation is novelty in how value is created and distributed."
It could be new products and services, but it could also be new ways of producing products.
It could also be novel ways of organizing firms and industries.
Once you take this, there's no reason to restrict innovation, the beneficiaries of innovation, just to end users.
When you take this broader conceptualization of innovation, what we found was, India is well represented in innovation, but the innovation that is being done in India is of a form we did not anticipate, and what we did was we called it "invisible innovation."
And specifically, there are four types of invisible innovation that are coming out of India.
The first type of invisible innovation out of India is what we call innovation for business customers, which is led by the multinational corporations, which have -- in the last two decades, there have been 750 R&D centers set up in India by multinational companies employing more than 400,000 professionals.
Now, when you consider the fact that, historically, the R&D center of a multinational company was always in the headquarters, or in the country of origin of that multinational company, to have 750 R&D centers of multinational corporations in India is truly a remarkable figure.
When we went and talked to the people in those innovation centers and asked them what are they working on, they said, "We are working on global products."
They were not working on localizing global products for India, which is the usual role of a local R&D.
They were working on truly global products, and companies like Microsoft, Google, AstraZeneca, General Electric, Philips, have already answered in the affirmative the question that from their Bangalore and Hyderabad R&D centers they are able to produce products and services for the world.
But of course, as an end user, you do n't see that, because you only see the name of the company, not where it was developed.
The other thing we were told then was, "Yes, but, you know, the kind of work that is coming out of the Indian R&D center can not be compared to the kind of work that is coming out of the U.S. R&D centers."
So my coauthor Phanish Puranam, who happens to be one of the smartest people I know, said he's going to do a study.
What he did was he looked at those companies that had an R&D center in USA and in India, and then he looked at a patent that was filed out of the U.S. and a similar patent filed out of the same company's subsidiary in India, so he's now comparing the patents of R&D centers in the U.S. with R&D centers in India of the same company to find out what is the quality of the patents filed out of the Indian centers and how do they compare with the quality of the patents filed out of the U.S. centers?
Interestingly, what he finds is - and by the way, the way we look at the quality of a patent is what we call forward citations: How many times does a future patent reference the older patent? he finds something very interesting.
What we find is that the data says that the number of forward citations of a patent filed out of a U.S. R&D subsidiary is identical to the number of forward citations of a patent filed by an Indian subsidiary of the same company within that company.
So within the company, there's no difference in the forward citation rates of their Indian subsidiaries versus their U.S. subsidiaries.
So that's the first kind of invisible innovation coming out of India.
The second kind of invisible innovation coming out of India is what we call outsourcing innovation to Indian companies, where many companies today are contracting Indian companies to do a major part of their product development work for their global products which are going to be sold to the entire world.
For example, in the pharma industry, a lot of the molecules are being developed, but you see a major part of that work is being sent to India.
For example, XCL Technologies, they developed two of the mission critical systems for the new Boeing 787 Dreamliner, one to avoid collisions in the sky, and another to allow landing in zero visibility.
But of course, when you climb onto the Boeing 787, you are not going to know that this is invisible innovation out of India.
The third kind of invisible innovation coming out of India is what we call process innovations, because of an injection of intelligence by Indian firms.
Process innovation is different from product innovation.
It's about how do you create a new product or develop a new product or manufacture a new product, but not a new product itself?
Only in India do millions of young people dream of working in a call center.
What happens - You know, it's a dead end job in the West, what high school dropouts do.
What happens when you put hundreds of thousands of smart, young, ambitious kids on a call center job?
Very quickly, they get bored, and they start innovating, and they start telling the boss how to do this job better, and out of this process innovation comes product innovations, which are then marketed around the world.
For example, 24 /7 Customer, traditional call center company, used to be a traditional call center company. Today they're developing analytical tools to do predictive modeling so that before you pick up the phone, you can guess or predict what this phone call is about.
It's because of an injection of intelligence into a process which was considered dead for a long time in the West.
And the last kind of innovation, invisible innovation coming out of India is what we call management innovation.
It's not a new product or a new process but a new way to organize work, and the most significant management innovation to come out of India, invented by the Indian offshoring industry is what we call the global delivery model.
What the global delivery model allows is, it allows you to take previously geographically core - located tasks, break them up into parts, send them around the world where the expertise and the cost structure exists, and then specify the means for reintegrating them.
Without that, you could not have any of the other invisible innovations today.
So, what I'm trying to say is, what we are finding in our research is, that if products for end users is the visible tip of the innovation iceberg, India is well represented in the invisible, large, submerged portion of the innovation iceberg.
Now, this has, of course, some implications, and so we developed three implications of this research.
The first is what we called sinking skill ladder, and now I'm going to go back to where I started my conversation with you, which was about the flight of jobs.
Now, of course, when we first, as a multinational company, decide to outsource jobs to India in the R&D, what we are going to do is we are going to outsource the bottom rung of the ladder to India, the least sophisticated jobs, just like Tom Friedman would predict.
Now, what happens is, when you outsource the bottom rung of the ladder to India for innovation and for R&D work, at some stage in the very near future you are going to have to confront a problem, which is where does the next step of the ladder people come from within your company?
So you have two choices then: Either you bring the people from India into the developed world to take positions in the next step of the ladder - immigration - or you say, there's so many people in the bottom step of the ladder waiting to take the next position in India, why do n't we move the next step to India?
What we are trying to say is that once you outsource the bottom end of the ladder, you - it's a self - perpetuating act, because of the sinking skill ladder, and the sinking skill ladder is simply the point that you ca n't be an investment banker without having been an analyst once.
You ca n't be a professor without having been a student.
You ca n't be a consultant without having been a research associate.
So, if you outsource the least sophisticated jobs, at some stage, the next step of the ladder has to follow.
The second thing we bring up is what we call the browning of the TMT, the top management teams.
If the R&D talent is going to be based out of India and China, and the largest growth markets are going to be based out of India and China, you have to confront the problem that your top management of the future is going to have to come out of India and China, because that's where the product leadership is, that's where the important market leadership is.
And the last thing we point out in this slide, which is, you know, that to this story, there's one caveat.
India has the youngest growing population in the world.
This demographic dividend is incredible, but paradoxically, there's also the mirage of mighty labor pools.
Indian institutes and educational system, with a few exceptions, are incapable of producing students in the quantity and quality needed to keep this innovation engine going, so companies are finding innovative ways to overcome this, but in the end it does not absolve the government of the responsibility for creating this educational structure.
So finally, I want to conclude by showing you the profile of one company, IBM.
As many of you know, IBM has always been considered for the last hundred years to be one of the most innovative companies.
In fact, if you look at the number of patents filed over history, I think they are in the top or the top two or three companies in the world of all patents filed in the USA as a private company.
Here is the profile of employees of IBM over the last decade.
In 2003, they had 300,000 employees, or 330,000 employees, out of which, 135,000 were in America, 9,000 were in India.
In 2009, they had 400,000 employees, by which time the U.S. employees had moved to 105,000, whereas the Indian employees had gone to 100,000.
Well, in 2010, they decided they're not going to reveal this data anymore, so I had to make some estimates based on various sources.
Here are my best guesses.
I'm not saying this is the exact number, it's my best guess.
It gives you a sense of the trend.
There are 433,000 people now at IBM, out of which 98,000 are remaining in the U.S., and 150,000 are in India.
So you tell me, is IBM an American company, or an Indian company?
(Laughter) Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much.
When my father and I started a company to 3D print human tissues and organs, some people initially thought we were a little crazy.
But since then, much progress has been made, both in our lab and other labs around the world.
And given this, we started getting questions like, "If you can grow human body parts, can you also grow animal products like meat and leather?"
When someone first suggested this to me, quite frankly I thought they were a little crazy, but what I soon came to realize was that this is not so crazy after all.
What's crazy is what we do today.
I'm convinced that in 30 years, when we look back on today and on how we raise and slaughter billions of animals to make our hamburgers and our handbags, we'll see this as being wasteful and indeed crazy.
Did you know that today we maintain a global herd of 60 billion animals to provide our meat, dairy, eggs and leather goods?
And over the next few decades, as the world's population expands to 10 billion, this will need to nearly double to 100 billion animals.
But maintaining this herd takes a major toll on our planet.
Animals are not just raw materials.
They're living beings, and already our livestock is one of the largest users of land, fresh water, and one of the biggest producers of greenhouse gases which drive climate change.
On top of this, when you get so many animals so close together, it creates a breeding ground for disease and opportunities for harm and abuse.
Clearly, we can not continue on this path which puts the environment, public health, and food security at risk.
There is another way, because essentially, animal products are just collections of tissues, and right now we breed and raise highly complex animals only to create products that are made of relatively simple tissues.
What if, instead of starting with a complex and sentient animal, we started with what the tissues are made of, the basic unit of life, the cell?
This is biofabrication, where cells themselves can be used to grow biological products like tissues and organs.
Already in medicine, biofabrication techniques have been used to grow sophisticated body parts, like ears, windpipes, skin, blood vessels and bone, that have been successfully implanted into patients.
And beyond medicine, biofabrication can be a humane, sustainable and scalable new industry.
And we should begin by reimagining leather.
I emphasize leather because it is so widely used.
It is beautiful, and it has long been a part of our history.
Growing leather is also technically simpler than growing other animal products like meat.
It mainly uses one cell type, and it is largely two - dimensional.
It is also less polarizing for consumers and regulators.
Until biofabrication is better understood, it is clear that, initially at least, more people would be willing to wear novel materials than would be willing to eat novel foods, no matter how delicious.
In this sense, leather is a gateway material, a beginning for the mainstream biofabrication industry.
If we can succeed here, it brings our other consumer bioproducts like meat closer on the horizon.
Now how do we do it?
To grow leather, we begin by taking cells from an animal, through a simple biopsy.
The animal could be a cow, lamb, or even something more exotic.
This process does no harm, and Daisy the cow can live a happy life.
We then isolate the skin cells and multiply them in a cell culture medium.
This takes millions of cells and expands them into billions.
And we then coax these cells to produce collagen, as they would naturally.
This collagen is the stuff between cells.
It's natural connective tissue.
It's the extracellular matrix, but in leather, it's the main building block.
And what we next do is we take the cells and their collagen and we spread them out to form sheets, and then we layer these thin sheets on top of one another, like phyllo pastry, to form thicker sheets, which we then let mature.
And finally, we take this multilayered skin and through a shorter and much less chemical tanning process, we create leather.
And so I'm very excited to show you, for the first time, the first batch of our cultured leather, fresh from the lab.
This is real, genuine leather, without the animal sacrifice.
It can have all the characteristics of leather because it is made of the same cells, and better yet, there is no hair to remove, no scars or insect's bites, and no waste.
This leather can be grown in the shape of a wallet, a handbag or a car seat.
It is not limited to the irregular shape of a cow or an alligator.
And because we make this material, we grow this leather from the ground up, we can control its properties in very interesting ways.
This piece of leather is a mere seven tissue layers thick, and as you can see, it is nearly transparent.
And this leather is 21 layers thick and quite opaque.
You do n't have that kind of fine control with conventional leather.
And we can tune this leather for other desirable qualities, like softness, breathability, durability, elasticity and even things like pattern.
We can mimic nature, but in some ways also improve upon it.
This type of leather can do what today's leather does, but with imagination, probably much more.
What could the future of animal products look like?
It need not look like this, which is actually the state of the art today.
Rather, it could be much more like this.
Already, we have been manufacturing with cell cultures for thousands of years, beginning with products like wine, beer and yogurt.
And speaking of food, our cultured food has evolved, and today we prepare cultured food in beautiful, sterile facilities like this.
It is where cell culture takes place.
Imagine that in this facility, instead of brewing beer, we were brewing leather or meat.
Imagine touring this facility, learning about how the leather or meat is cultured, seeing the process from beginning to end, and even trying some.
It's clean, open and educational, and this is in contrast to the hidden, guarded and remote factories where leather and meat is produced today.
Perhaps biofabrication is a natural evolution of manufacturing for mankind.
It's environmentally responsible, efficient and humane.
It allows us to be creative.
We can design new materials, new products, and new facilities.
We need to move past just killing animals as a resource to something more civilized and evolved.
Perhaps we are ready for something literally and figuratively more cultured.
Tales from Briarcliff by Lana Winters, read by the author.
Behind the stone walls of Briarcliff, time had no meaning.
The days themselves seemed to exist in a kind of perpetual twilight.
You were n't conceived in love, but in hate.
I could n't wait to give you up.
You're an abomination.
I was in the third week of my confinement, and a storm was coming.
The nor'easter of '64 that brought so much devastation with it, and for me, something else, something far more savage even than nature.
Oliver Thredson was, to all appearances, a kindly figure, fatherly in his manner.
This face he showed the world, this face of sanity and benevolence, that was his real mask.
Underneath lurked the real Oliver Thredson, an unspeakable monster.
I loved you even when you were still in your mother's womb.
I would have given anything to be a real father to you, but she kept us apart.
She stole it from you.
From both of us.
The Catholic Church bought this place in '62, and turned it into a sanitarium for the criminally insane.
Legend has it that once you were committed at Briarcliff, you never got out.
The most famous resident was a serial killer named...
Maybe it's Bloody Face.
Maybe it's just old pipes.
I want to know what's in there.
Do it again and I'll blow you.
And who did this drawing of you?
He was a bit tipsy on the airplane coming back from Somalia and drew it on the cocktail napkin.
He's quite good, is n't he?
Be sure and get an insert of that, Pete.
So with six bestsellers, a reputation as the only one the men will open up to, world leaders, stars, disgraced politicians, who's the one that got away?
Is there anyone you lusted after that you missed?
And she's still lusting after Julian Assange.
Uh, look, I know
I said no on - camera appearances for you, but I love this whole bringing the chardonnay thing, super casual, loving.
What about just that?
I saw your Norma at the Met.
She's doing it in Bologna this summer.
I've got rehearsal;
I'll be back by 5:00.
We have that Sondheim dinner birthday thing tonight.
Am I not the luckiest woman alive?
A little higher, babe.
Mm- mm, higher still.
Oh, what are they teaching these kids in film school?
God knows it's not how to make us old gals look more gorgeous.
Nothing old about you, Lana.
Well, thanks to a very talented surgeon in Paris and a great dermatologist.
So, what are we covering today?
Well, since it's a Kennedy Center honor
I'd say it's a pretty big canvas.
Jesus, darling, I hope this is n't going to feel like a eulogy.
I will certainly ask you about your notorious nail - to - the - cross prison interview with Madoff.
I'd like to go back and start with the early years.
I said I would n't talk about that.
People want to hear about it.
It's what made you famous.
He's become a goddamn household name.
Like some kind of Heath Ledger, Hollywood movie star villain.
He was an evil monster who used murder and torture to keep himself from feeling like a eunuch.
I refuse to give him one more second of air time.
So then let's start with the event that made your reputation as a crusader for change, the Briarcliff exposé.
We good to go, everyone?
Honey, hand me that mirror, will you?
I like to do my own eyebrows.
Like a million bucks.
But they're still not gonna let us in that front door with a camera.
Oh, I know how to get in.
Jesus, how did you find this place?
Listen, when we get inside, no matter what happens, or what anybody says, you keep shooting.
We need to document the conditions, the filth, these people are forced to live in.
I want the footage to shock the public out of their complacency, you understand?
I want moral outrage.
I want to put America in the asylum.
The fact that you would voluntarily go back into the place where you almost died, that's why you were held in such high esteem by all of America and your peers.
Did you always have this need for justice?
That's the myth.
Lana Winters, crusader.
It was n't justice that got me back to Briarcliff.
You had an abrupt career change.
I knew television was the future.
So I got started in local news, then an NBC affiliate before I landed my own series of investigative reports.
With TV, words, they're less important.
But you need more than that.
You need an angle, a hook.
I heard from very reliable sources that Sister Jude, the nun that imprisoned me at Briarcliff, was still alive.
In fact, she had become a patient there herself.
Milo, I told you to keep rolling.
Get the camera up and pointed at me.
At Briarcliff Manor, it's not uncommon to see patients left on their own without supervision, without stimulation, for hours on end.
The squalor, the filth, the decay of this institution is a shocking indictment of the abandonment of her most needy by the state of Massachusetts.
The Church sold Briarcliff Manor to the state of Massachusetts in the fall of 1965.
Since then, conditions have deteriorated.
You need a slate? Are... Yeah, are you sleeping?
The church sold Briarcliff Manor to the state of Massachusetts in the fall of 1965.
Since then, conditions have deteriorated.
These images and sounds are far more powerful than any words that can be spoken.
But how can I describe to you the way it smells?
It reeks of filth, of disease.
It smells of death.
Do you... have permission to do this?
You are the first attendant we've seen the entire time we've been here.
Is it the policy to leave patients unclothed and unclean, some of them smeared in their own feces?
Right now I'm interested in one.
I demand to see Judy Martin.
Do you remember me?
You were committed to Briarcliff to cover up the abuses the church and science had perpetrated against patients here.
You were left to die.
I've come back to help you.
I'm going to get you out of here, Sister Jude.
Such a powerful scene you describe.
That's because it never happened.
I should've gone back sooner.
But you did shut down Briarcliff.
Yes, but it's not the ending I wanted.
It was one hell of an ending, just not the one I wanted.
And there's your promo.
I need to freshen up.
Ms. Winters needs a break.
Five and we're back.
Would you like something to drink?
I'd love a sparkling water.
Would you get Ms. Winters a sparkling water, please?
My pleasure, Ms. Winters.
I was just watching the news.
You really did it.
I wanted them to capture our reunion.
Like who's Betty Drake?
And is she here?
I'll talk to you, Lana, but... but I'm not gonna talk to your camera.
Where'd you find this?
I was still trying to find Jude.
Jude had n't existed for years.
The Monsignor saw to that.
Betty Drake, released to the care of Kit Walker,
March 27, 1970.
That was just a few months after you came to see me at the book signing.
It's Jude, is n't it?
Why do you care now, Lana?
We all just part of your story?
It's not just my story, Kit.
It's yours, too.
You went back for her.
Cause it was something I could do.
I mean, I could n't shut the place down,
I could n't lead them all out of there like Moses.
But, Jude, whatever she was, she did n't belong there any more than we did.
After Alma died, I...
You brought her into your home.
After all the indignities she made you suffer?
I did n't even really do it for me.
I did it for the kids.
For a while, things seemed to be going along pretty well, considering.
No matter how much she barked at them, they always understood something about her.
Well, it got worse before it got better.
Told you to start in the corner!
Did you think I would n't notice?
I'll cane you!
This is not Briarcliff, and you will not hit my kids!
What's going on here?
No, we do not have a children's ward!
I told your mother that.
I was very clear.
I was very clear!
You will address me as Sister Jude.
You do n't fool me, Kit Walker.
I know what you did.
No, you get away!
I wo n't go back in that hole!
- You ca n't make me!
Get your sister and go outside.
No, you ca n't make me!
I still do n't know what happened in those woods.
When they came back... something was different.
Those children are special.
Okay, I'm gonna teach you a new step.
Toe, heel, step back.
Okay, now, start again, watch me.
You're left, and I'm right.
Because women are always right.
Do n't say I never taught you nothing.
Daddy, dance with me.
Let me show this to you.
For six months, she taught them how to swing dance and swear like a sailor.
Made Thomas learn to sew and took away Julia's dolls and gave her trucks so she'd grow up tough.
I do n't know if those last six months made up for a lifetime of horrors... but she sure seemed happy.
Come here, you two.
I got a few more things to tell you, okay?
Julia, do n't you ever let a man tell you who you are or make you feel like you are less than he is.
And you can do anything you want.
Find something... that you love.
Oh, I do n't need that.
It's mushroom barley.
You got to eat something.
Kids, why do n't you go pile up the leaves in the yard?
I'm staying with Nana.
No, you guys, you should go outside and play.
Kit Walker... you're a lucky man.
You better not screw them up.
I'm not going to leave you alone.
She's here for me.
I do n't know who she was talking about.
Are you sure you're ready this time?
I'm ready now.
I have a feeling we're about to enter the hard - hitting part of the interview.
It was the pen, was n't it?
No need to take notes on powder - puff questions.
You got me, but I'm gonna ask anyway.
If shutting down Briarcliff was such an undeniable success, your next exposé was, to put it mildly, controversial.
I think half of New York wanted to lynch me, and the other half would have had me banned from the state.
Can we talk about what happened with Cardinal Howard?
At the time, he was a powerhouse, a rising star in the church.
The man had avoided me for weeks.
I have nothing to say to you, Miss Winters.
With or without your comments, I'm airing a report tomorrow night on Dr. Arthur Arden, a man you hired to run the medical unit at Briarcliff.
We finally gained access to his files.
Did you know he was conducting human experiments?
We found some very disturbing evidence.
Would you mind switching that off, please?
A number of patients disappeared under his care.
Do you have any idea what happened to them?
It was over seven years ago.
You ca n't expect me to remember anything about patients I was n't responsible for.
I'm afraid you are responsible.
And there is no statute of limitations on murder, Cardinal Howard.
The police have found remains, human bones in the woods outside Briarcliff.
They're going to start asking hard questions.
And since the notorious Dr. Arden has disappeared, they're going to be looking to you for answers.
What are you running from, Cardinal Howard?
Out of the way, Miss Winters!
What are you running from?
To this day, people still blame you for what happened to him.
I've got broad shoulders, but I ca n't take credit for what his guilty conscience made him do.
I have a feeling we're not just talking about Cardinal Howard anymore.
Is there something you'd like to share with us?
I'm going to come clean about a lie
I've told for over 40 years.
I write about the abuse, the rape, the pregnancy.
I say that the baby died in childbirth.
I even wrote about a kind of poetic justice that the child had n't lived.
That child is alive.
I did n't raise him, but someone did.
Do n't ask me to do that again.
I could n't muster it.
I tried, but I could n't.
That's quite a secret, Lana.
The only person I've told is Marian.
There was a period in the mid-'70s where I suffered a terrible remorse about giving him up.
I just needed to see him.
What you got in here?
Shut up, asshole!
You back off before I hurt you in ways you have n't even dreamt of.
You know he's the asshole, right?
You should report him.
I was n't his mother.
I would only confuse him.
But I thought about him so often.
Wondering where he was.
How he turned out.
Did you ever think about having children after that?
It was a different time for gay women.
Most of us were resigned to not having children.
But I was close to my friends' children.
Kit Walker... he asked me to be godmother to his kids.
Kit got married again.
They grew up with that message, and they lived up to it.
Thomas is a law professor at Harvard.
Julie is a leading neurosurgeon at Johns Hopkins.
Kit would be so proud of them.
Is he no longer with us?
When he was around 40, he developed pancreatic cancer.
They gave him chemo, but it was just a waiting game.
And no one could explain exactly what happened.
No note, no tracks, no clues.
Kit's children insisted there was no reason to mourn.
Ms. Winters, I ca n't tell you what an honor this has been for me.
Oh, try not to, darling.
I just hope you got what you need.
I thought we'd just be doing your greatest hits, but all the personal stuff... fantastic, unexpected and very moving.
Can I pour you a drink?
Why do n't you come out now?
You do n't need to hide.
So I guess you've had a pretty great life, huh?
It's been eventful.
It's about to end.
You get that, right?
I knew it the moment I saw you.
I do n't mind.
How did you manage to get yourself on the crew?
I've been waiting outside the building, got friendly with the doorman, he told me about the interview.
He's in the trash bin.
This is n't how I pictured it.
Because this is exactly how I pictured it.
I always knew this day would come.
I did n't think you'd recognize me.
How could I not recognize my own baby boy?
48 years old, unmarried.
We think he's responsible for the deaths of at least five people.
Including the elderly couple who lived in the house formerly owned by Oliver Thredson.
The place you were held at and tortured in '64, Ms. Winters.
Are you sure you do n't recognize him?
You look like him, you know?
It's easy for me to forget just how handsome he was.
Until you shot him in the head.
Yes, I shot him in the head.
How did you find out?
That you murdered my father?
About who you were.
That day on the playground.
And I saw you on the TV.
"That's my mother," I'd tell people.
And they'd just laugh at me, but I knew.
And I dreamed one day that you'd come back.
Then I heard the tape, and, uh...
I found it on eBay.
Lana, no, please!
No baby should have to grow up knowing Daddy is Bloody Face.
My father loved me.
That's when I started loving him.
He never loved you, Johnny.
No, I did n't love you.
You'd have a chance at a life, you mean!
So what's it going to be, Johnny?
I do n't imagine, at my age, you'd be much interested in the skin.
I've thought about this.
I've thought about this a lot.
I was n't expecting that.
Your father once told me he did n't believe in guns.
Of course, he was lying about that, too.
You do n't get to talk about him.
What are you so afraid of, Johnny?
The truth about him or the truth about you?
I just want him to be proud of me.
I ca n't measure up.
He was a monster.
Yes, he was.
No, he was n't.
But that's not you.
You could never be like him.
Not that... sweet little boy I met on the playground.
Even then, I knew you were a better man than he was.
I'm a part of you, too.
I've hurt people.
It's not your fault, baby.
That he's going to be admitted here today.
Is there any way I could meet him?
You're out of your depth,
You want a story?
A girl like you, you like to dream large.
I'd venture you already have Briarcliff in your rearview mirror.
No, I'm saying it's dangerous.
Saving the souls of madmen and killers is a pretty lofty ambition, would n't you say?
And you can not imagine what it took to get here.
I'd love to hear your story someday.
I do n't think you and I are destined to meet again.
But I do hope you know what you're in for.
The loneliness, the heartbreak, the sacrifice you'll face as a woman with a dream on her own.
You do n't have any idea what I'm capable of.
Look at you, Miss Lana Banana.
Just remember... if you look in the face of evil.
Evil's going to look right back at you.
In the year 2026... archaeologists working in the Nevada desert... discovered a portal to an ancient city on Mars.
They called this portal the Ark.
Twenty years later, we're still struggling to understand... why it was built... and what happened to the civilization that built it.
This is Dr. Carmack, Classified Research, Olduvai, ID 6627.
Implement quarantine procedures immediately.
Implement quarantine procedures now.
Union Aerospace has requested assistance to contain... a Level 5 breach at their Olduvai facility.
How many personnel involved?
Six scientists are under lockdown in a high - security lab... where the breach occurred.
Another 79 UAC employees are on site.
Ark travel has been suspended.
What's the objective?
Assess level of threat.
Maintain quarantine at both Ark portals by any means necessary.
If necessary, search and destroy.
I confess to God the father.
Hey, relax, baby. We're on vacation.
This game's layered, man.
Where you going, Portman?
You're sick, man.
I'm sick of your filth, Portman. He speaks.
What's it gonna be, Reaps?
An armed conflict someplace quiet?
Yeah, a little relaxing jungle warfare?
Or maybe you're just gonna stay right here.
Spending my time doing pushups.
Got a problem with that, Duke?
Hell, no, I love my job.
What's up, Sarge?
We got us a game.
All dressed up and nowhere to go, huh, Portman?
Shut up, Portman.
Not this time, John.
We can handle this one.
No, I'm not bullshitting.
We're going to Olduvai.
Is that an order?
Almost like we've never been away.
Okay, Sarge, roger.
RRTS Special Ops clearance verified.
Say my name, baby.
I ca n't believe we're going through the Ark.
Do n't worry, Kid.
You're gonna love it.
RRTS air 6, we're airborne and en route.
The next day he brought you onto the team.
Do n't give me an excuse, Portman.
No one here will miss you.
Men, look in.
This is what we got from Simcon.
We have a quarantine situation on Olduvai.
They sent this message... when the research team stopped responding to all communications.
This is Dr. Carmack, Classified Research, Olduvai, ID 6627.
Implement quarantine procedures now.
We need to go up there, locate the team... eliminate the threat and secure the facility.
If it's trying to kill you, it's a threat.
Rescue mission heading 147 degrees.
Location Lima, Zulu, Foxtrot 14.
Sure she's even still up there?
I guess you gotta face your demon sometime.
Look alive, men. Game time.
I checked it... at least three times before we sent it through.
Sanford Crosby, UAC Public Relations.
Now follow me, please.
How many people you got up there?
UAC employs 85 permanent research staff on Olduvai.
Welcome to the Ark, gentlemen.
All personnel, prepare for activation.
Keep your distance from the core or you might get sucked in.
You, uh, you done this before?
All telemetry verified and transmissions are five - by - five.
Soon as we get through, I need you to shut down the surface elevator here.
Make sure that we get the standard quarantine of six hours.
Ark travel, 15 seconds and counting.
Why we gotta come all this way?
Is it always that rough?
Believe me, it used to be a lot rougher.
There was a time when Ark travel was susceptible to, let's say... major turbulence.
Unbelievable as it may seem, UAC does make the odd tiny mistake.
You call me Pinky.
Where are the personnel who are n't locked down in the lab?
Pinky, put us up.
Activating remote personnel surveillance.
Circle out men, on my three.
People, this room is a code red, which means... no one gets in without our permission.
It stays ours at all costs.
Mac, stay here with our friend and secure the door.
Men, on me. Let's move out.
Who called in the military?
Couple million light years from breakfast.
When can I start evacuating people out through the Ark?
We're at a Level 5 quarantine, nobody goes anywhere.
Ladies, we're under a Level 5 quarantine... so I'm just gonna have to strip search you girls.
Sergeant, this is Dr. Samantha Grimm, the UAC science officer... assigned to retrieve data from the lab.
Sarge, this operation is a code red.
We really do n't have room for passengers.
Anthropology, Forensic Archeology, and Genetics.
This is a military operation, Doctor.
We're really not here to retrieve your science homework.
Look, I got an idea.
Why do n't you ask your CO what your orders are?
To contain and neutralize the threat, protect the civilians... and retrieve -- retrieve UAC property.
Because I've got a job to do.
If you'll follow me?
You chose this, Reaper.
Is this gonna spoil my day?
Tell me you did n't let a fine - looking piece of ass... like that get away from you, Reaper.
She's my sister.
Do n't do this again, man.
There's three sections to Carmack's lab complex.
Archeology, Genetics, and Weapons Research.
Well, it's a dead planet.
You want that stuff tested here, where it's safe, or in your own backyard?
We're primarily an archeological operation.
Weapons Research is in its own separate facility.
It has nothing to do with Dr. Carmack's work.
How many inside when the lab shut down?
Only Dr. Carmack's team.
In one of the carbon dating labs, there was an internal phone... left off the hook.
Did you get any information from it?
Portman, Goat, lead on.
Magnesium, chromium, lead.
Pinky, give us a schematic.
The airlock is the only way in or out.
Carmack's office, where he sent the mayday from.
Reaper, keep Dr. Grimm here safe on her salvage op.
Duke and I'll take the weapons lab, make sure all the hardware's secure.
Fluorescent markings as rooms are cleared.
You do n't look like a "Mac."
Pinky, you getting this?
Where the hell is everybody?
There's another room to the north.
What the hell is that?
You never did time, Portman?
This is a holding cell.
I'd hate to see what they lock up.
Hey, Sarge, what's the deal with the sister?
Reaper's parents led the first team of archeologists to Olduvai.
They died in some accident when he was a kid.
She followed in their footsteps, and he did n't.
No, what I meant was, is she single?
Please provide DNA verification.
All units report contact.
God damn it, all units report contact.
Friendly fire, Sarge.
As in "Grim"?
Oh, yeah, meet Lucy.
Lucy, this is my brother, John... another creature from the long lost past.
Lucy and her child were our first major find.
We're bringing out more every day.
I know I should have told you.
I did n't figure it was the sort of thing...
I could jot down on a yearly birthday card.
It's been stabilized.
You wanna talk about safe?
Like you took a desk job?
I'm a forensic archeologist, John.
I'll go where the work is.
Is that the only reason you're up here?
You wanna know why I'm up here?
I'll show you. Come here.
This is Lucy's chromosome profile.
My molecular genetics is a little rusty.
What's the first thing Dad taught us to look for?
She's got 24 pairs of chromosomes.
Humans only have 23.
But what does the extra pair do?
The fossil record indicates these people had conquered disease.
So what, they were just naturally superior?
We suspect this extra chromosome may be synthetic.
That's a long word for a Marine.
Does it ever bother you... you could've spent your life looking in a microscope... instead of a sniper scope?
If they were so smart, how come they're so dead?
We do n't know.
Maybe they just went with time.
You do n't shield a baby from time.
We got movement up ahead.
You stay here, okay?
There's something in Carmack's office.
Moving east through Carmack's office!
Moving fast, over south corridor.
Sam, I told you to stay -- But he knows me, John.
Dr. Carmack, it's me.
I'm not gonna hurt you.
Get a med kit.
I'm not gonna hurt you.
Duke, get him to the infirmary with Dr. Grimm.
Portman, Kid, go to the airlock and dig in.
Anything trying to get away from us will get driven straight to you.
Now let's see if we can find the body that goes with that arm.
I tell you, man.
Do you have any?
Do I have any?
I'm just a little shook up.
I need something to get my focus, man.
There is a God.
I think we found the rest of that arm.
No, no, I do n't do nanowalls.
Yes, you do.
My husband is with them.
I'm sure Steve's fine.
Dr. Carmack, I'm going to take your blood pressure.
Hey -- It's okay, it's okay.
I can feel it.
Shut it, shut it down. Shut it down.
That's affirmative, Reaper.
Looks like we missed the party.
We were just here.
We're here to help.
Sir, are you okay?
We found another one of the scientists.
Some kind of monkey.
There's something in his blood.
Reaper, what have you got?
Give me a confirmation on what you're seeing.
It's in the sewer.
Southeast corridor near the med lab.
I can handle things here.
I want to stay.
Steve is gonna be okay.
Go on, go on. Be with your daughter.
"No blood match." Ca n't be good, right?
It leads back under the lab complex.
Destroyer, cover the exit.
We got a Dr. Willits.
"because your adversary, the devil..." walketh about seeking whom he may devour. "
That's real comforting, Goat.
That ai n't freaking me out at all.
Quick, he's slipping back.
Portman, what the hell happened?
I fell in the damn hole.
Everybody, on me. Watch your goddamn footing.
Goat, straight ahead. Sir.
Portman, you're with me.
John, take the Kid and go to the right.
You lost your folks, right?
Small world. I mean, I lost my parents, too.
Yeah, I mean, I woke up one morning... and everything was gone.
I mean, the only thing left was me.
They wanted the TV more than they wanted me.
Your pupils are dilated.
No, I got this condition -- I do n't give a damn.
I'm sorry, look, I just needed a little
Goat, I think there's something coming up on you.
My light is down.
Goat, what's your position?
Goat, where are you?
Goat, speak to me.
God damn it, Reaper, report to me.
Everyone, get to the Ark now!
Hunegs, report to the quarantine zone.
Evacuate the entire facility.
Get everyone to the Ark now.
Get to the goddamn Ark.
Everybody to the Ark.
Let's get this vest off him.
Now he's clear.
Got a weak pulse.
Come on, man.
Kid, keep pressure on that wound.
How's the pulse?
Sam, give me a shot of adrenaline.
We lost the pulse.
Sam, give me that adrenaline.
Okay, going again.
This is "what."
Have you found anything like this... on your archeological digs?
The planet is completely dead.
It came from somewhere, lady.
Portman, shut up!
The atmosphere on the surface ca n't support life.
Maybe it does n't need air.
It could have come from another planet or something.
Look at that thing!
That is n't what Goat and I shot at in Genetics.
Where are your surface entry points?
There's a pressure door at the end of the north corridor.
Destroyer, Kid, Portman, get there on the double.
Give me an update.
Whatever this thing is... it can not get back through the Ark.
Mac, I want you to arm Pinky with a weapon... with some ST grenades, and seal the Ark door.
There's one other door.
The entrance to the archeological dig.
Ark portal activation in progress.
Do n't let anything through the Ark.
Hey, wait. Wait a minute.
You ca n't leave me here.
I'm not a soldier.
You're supposed to protect me.
Remaining personnel, ready for evacuation.
Do n't be a wuss.
Little tension between you and Reaper?
Why does a talented student throw it all away and join the RRTS?
So, what was he like before?
It's kind of hard for me to imagine Reaper as sensitive.
You know, we grew up together.
You know, Duke, I bet secretly you have a big heart.
And that's not the only secret big thing I got.
Oh, lady, you have no idea.
I need a power bone saw.
Girl, I've been waiting on you my whole life.
Down the corridor, on the left, through the nanowall.
For you I got it, 'cause you're pretty.
I would n't do it for a dude, you know.
We're going back in through the airlock.
We're not calling in backup?
The Ark is sealed.
Pick up your weapon, Portman.
Did n't y'all see how that thing greased Goat?
We do n't know what we're dealing with here.
We are... the reinforcements.
All UAC personnel evacuated to Earth.
It's just a power shortage.
Here's your bone saw.
So, which of you is the oldest?
Oh, me. By two minutes.
Sam, get back in the lab.
And that's why I do n't do nanowalls.
Pinky, we're entering the archeological dig.
Not too close, John.
Did you find the door?
They were n't trying to stop something from getting in.
Mac, stand by.
Console indicates nothing's come in or out for 26 hours.
Talk to me, Mac.
We're in pursuit.
Moving fast out of the dig.
It's getting away.
Pinky, what do you see?
It's back in the lab.
Damn, it's fast.
All around defense, men.
Did you get it?
Anything gets through that door... use an ST grenade.
It can not get back to Earth.
He pops an ST in there, he's gonna blow the Ark.
Reaper, Kid, pairs, cover formation.
Destroyer, you and Portman stay here.
I'm going to the armory.
You see anything like it before?
Dogs got kidneys, right?
It's had its appendix removed.
Goat knew he was turning.
This thing did n't butcher Willits.
Please provide DNA verification.
Welcome, Patricia Tallman.
Portman, I got floor and wall on your gun cam.
Lost Portman on comm... and all I've got on Destroyer is a wall.
Portman, come in.
This is Corporal Dean Portman... with RRTS 6 Special Ops on Olduvai, 0310 hours.
I repeat, require immediate RRTS reinforcements.
Destroyer, Portman, where the hell are you?
Pinky, you got Portman?
I got him, I got him.
Destroyer, I got you, man.
And whose goddamn blood is on that window?
What do you mean, he killed himself?
He was already dead.
We found two more scientists at the dig.
Thurman and a balding guy with glasses.
Did you check their necks?
Were there open wounds on their necks?
We were conducting a firefight, not an autopsy.
We came up here to find six scientists.
Four are known dead... and Dr. Willits is probably kia somewhere down in that sewer.
The only one missing is Dr. Carmack.
Has Dr. Carmack showed up yet?
Look at the left ear.
I think this other one is Steve Willits.
I'm going to run the DNA, check it against his med records.
What are you people working on up here?
We're analyzing bones, artifacts.
We're not doing anything like this.
It must be a genetic mutation, something environmental or viral.
It may even be reversible.
because Carmack's condition is that... he's dead.
Kid, you and Duke... get back to the dig and you make sure those other dead scientists... are really dead.
I've lost... four soldiers.
What are you people experimenting with up here?
I'm not gonna ask you again.
I told you, it's an archeological research center.
Do you think I'm lying to you?
You think I'm hiding something?
I'm telling the truth.
Vitals normal, elevated heart rate attributable to subject anxiety.
He reconstructed chromosome mutation on a human subject.
﻿We were never gonna do human studies.
What the hell are we looking at?
Genesis, Chapter 1.
49 minutes after injection, genetic mutations... began to visually manifest on subject's extremities.
This is what you're here to protect.
They lied to you.
They used you, Sam.
We need to destroy these discs.
That's UAC property.
We take the data back.
Sarge, do you not see what's going on here?
I have my orders.
I said, is this everything?
I, uh, have three more to download.
One dead scientist is missing.
You just wanna leave her here?
She's got a job to do.
Pinky, are you there?
Something is cutting through the Ark door.
Do n't let it get to the Ark!
Pinky, use the grenade!
Quarantine cordon is breached.
This mission is no longer containment.
Get all the weapons and ammo you can.
Sam, come in.
Sam, do you read me?
Time required to begin renewed operation... four minutes and 45 seconds.
Come in, Sam!
Why did they take Goat and not Destroyer?
Why Carmack and not Dr. Thurman?
Lucy had the 24th chromosome... but she was n't a monster.
She died protecting her child, not devouring it.
Why did the same chromosome that made her superhuman... turn Stahl into a monster?
Just give me a minute.
We do n't have a minute.
Then give me 10 seconds.
This is its tongue.
This is brain matter from Portman.
This is from Destroyer.
It's choosing, John.
It's choosing who to infect.
How is it choosing?
There are genetic markers for psychotic and violent behavior.
It could be a specific neurotransmitter... it's picking up on, a ganglion.
Latching onto numbers in the DNA code linked to --
Ten percent of the human genome is still unmapped.
Some say it's the genetic blueprint for the soul.
Maybe C - 24 is what destroyed the population.
It would explain why some of them had to build the Ark... to escape to a new beginning.
Some it made superhuman.
We gotta get out of here now.
The people quarantined on the other side of the Ark... they wo n't all be infected!
Sarge is going to kill them all.
Nothing gets to the elevator back on Earth.
We ca n't let them get to the surface.
If it breathes, kill it.
Five... four, three... two, one.
This is Corporal Dean Portman... with RRTS 6 Special Ops on Olduvai, 0310 hours.
We have encountered hostile activity.
Require immediate RRTS reinforcements.
We got 58 minutes before the auto lockdown is lifted.
Reset it for another six hours.
It's been disabled.
They're disabling computers now?
Yeah, they're rocket scientists, remember?
Sarge, what's your position?
Sarge, come in.
Come in, Sarge.
Do you read me?
Look, do not kill everybody.
I repeat, do not kill everybody.
They're not all infected.
Clear the rest of this sector and meet back at the Ark chamber.
Jesus Christ, what the hell are
Who the hell's in there?
You do n't have to kill all of them.
I do n't think everyone is infected, or even capable of being infected.
We have orders to contain this threat by any means necessary.
And we have orders to protect this facility.
We do n't have orders to kill innocent people.
We have to stop anything from getting to the surface... by any means... necessary.
Am I glad to see you guys.
That thing cut right through the door.
I tried to use the grenade but it came at me too fast.
Followed me through the Ark and started to kill everybody.
There's no wound on his neck.
I say who's clean... and who's not.
I mean, it was n't my fault.
Hey, I'm not a soldier.
You should n't have left me --
There's a storeroom to the south.
We gotta do something.
Your orders were to clear that sector.
No, I told them to stay put.
They're just scared shitless.
We kill them all.
Let God sort them out.
I think - Son, you do n't think.
We're in the field, soldier.
Sarge, if nothing's found them --
You will obey the direct order... of your commanding officer.
Mutinous insurrection is punishable... by death.
It was his first mission!
And it's not gonna be my last.
I do n't need anybody else but soldiers.
I have no intention of being killed by a madman.
The wall's not closing!
I'm not supposed to die.
How long before they get through?
This is an ST grenade.
When they come through... you pop the top and hit the button.
John, stay with me.
John, stay with me, please.
It's C - 24.
It's from Carmack's lab.
It could save you.
No way, forget it.
You're bleeding to death.
No way, Sam.
I've done some bad things.
One through the heart, one through the head... do n't you hesitate.
Last man standing, Reaper.
I think she needs medical attention.
Can you get to the elevator?
I'm not sure.
I took care of that problem.
Quarantine's almost over.
Power should be back on any minute.
You killed the Kid.
It's what they pay us for.
Elevators back on line.
What do you say we go outside and get some fresh air?
Are you gonna shoot me?
Yeah, I was thinking about it.
I've got one round.
Faithful to the Corps, John.
"Go to hell."
In a land of myth and time of magic, the destiny of a great kingdom rests of shoulders on a young boy.
The wound is superficial.
He should be fine by morning.
What creature could've done this?
We found no tracks in or out.
What the villagers say must be true.
.. and it took no livestock - only people.
Whatever it is, it has a taste for human flesh.
Post sentries at all the outlying villages.
Put the lookouts on full alert.
If this thing should make for Camelot, we must be ready.
Ever since I was a child, I've dreamed of coming here.
It's my life's ambition to join the knights of Camelot.
I know what you're thinking.
I... I expect too much.
After all, who am I?
They have their pick of the best and bravest in the land.
They're going to love you.
I've seen you in action.
I hardly think so.
In fact, you know what I'll do?
I'll talk to him right now.
Right, you jumped - up dung beetle, this is it final test.
Pass this and you're knight at Camelot,
Fail, and you're no - one.
You face the most feared of all foes, the ultimate killing machine.
Your challenge - the last one minute, free combat.
Grimond, second son of Wessex.
Your times starts now.
He's the third to fail this month.
How can I defend Camelot with rubbish like that?
You have no idea what it takes to be knight courage, fortitude, discipline.
No, of course I do n't.
He's really good, honestly.
I'm sure he's terrific.
You forget Camelot's first code.
Only noblemen can be knights.
So unless your friend is a nobleman...
Bring him to the training ground tomorrow.
Make sure he brings his seal of nobility.
You wo nt't regret it.
Did you speak to him?
He'd like to meet you.
Hey, it's no problem, really.
You're not a nobleman by any chance, are you?
Good lord, No.
Why do you ask?
The first code of Camelot states that only those of noble blood can serve as knight.
Uther created the knights to protect this kingdom from those who wish to destroy it.
He knew he'd have to trust each of his knights with his life.
So he chose those who'd sworn allegiance to him.
Thus the first code of Camelot was born.
And ever since that day, only sons of noble families have served as knights.
That is not fair.
Fair or unfair, that's the way it is.
I'm sorry, Lancelot.
Why do you want to be a knight so much?
When I was a boy, my village was attacked by raiders from northern plains.
They were slaughtered where they stood - my father, my mother, everyone.
I vowed that day that never again would I be helpless in the face of tyranny.
I made swordcraft my life.
Every waking hour since that day I devoted to the art of combat.
When I was ready, I set forth for Camelot.
And now it seems my journey ends.
Everything I've fought for - wasted.
I give you my word, whatever it takes, I will make this right.
Come on, come on yes!
It's, um, a real page - turner.
This is your seal of nobility.
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Lancelot, fifth son of Lord Eldred of Northumbira.
No, Merlin, no.
So you do n't want to be knight then.
The rules do n't allow it?
But it's a lie.
It's against everything that stands for.
You have as much right to be a knight as any man.
But the rules, Merlin...
We're not breaking the rules.
After that, you'll be judged on your merit alone.
And if you succeed, if they make you a knight, it'll be because you have earned it, noble or not.
I ca n't change the way things are done here, but you can... if you let me help you.
Then thank you, Guinevere.
Merlin would do anything for anyone.
Sorry, can you raise your arms?
I think it's great that Merlin's got you this chance.
Well, not me personally but, you know, Camelot.
Not just Arthur and his kind, but ordinary people like you and me.
I'm not a knight yet, my lady.
And I'm not a lady.
Ok, we're done.
I should have these ready in no time.
It's nice to meet you, Lancelot.
Oh, yeah, yeah, she is.
And the best seamstress in Camelot, I promise.
Are you two... you know?
You certainly look the part.
Does n't he just?
I do nt feel it.
That'll do for today.
Here's your chance.
Lancelot, fifth son of Lord Eldred of Northumbria.
My servant mentioned you.
On a battlefield, you'd be dead by now.
Come back when you're ready.
I'm ready now, sire.
You are, are you?
You can start by cleaning out the stables.
I'm sorry about Lancelot.
I could see you were upset.
Oh... you know, that's life.
You're taking it very well.
I have to say.
How'd it go?
He found work at the stables.
And the truth, before I lose my temper.
He's, uh... trying out for the knights.
The first code of Camelot has never been broken for any man.
What have you done, Merlin?
I bent the rules a little.
But they're wrong, they're unfair.
You bent the rules using magic?
It was nothing, honestly.
It was more of a trick than actual magic.
Your magic is not toy for you to use or abuse as you see fit.
Then why did you do it?
I owe Lancelot my life.
I am paying for that debt the only way I can by giving him the opportunity he deserves.
Would you like me sweep the guardhouse agian, sire?
It certainly needs sweeping.
First, I'd like you to kill me.
Do n't pretend you do nt want to.
Hell, if I were you, I'd want to.
You just made basic trainning.
Their village was attacked by a winged monster.
I'd hunt this thing, but I ca nt track a creature through the air.
You do nt have to track it.
First Greensward, then Willowdale.
It's heading south towards the mouth of the valley.
You must prepare your knights, Arthur.
We'll be ready.
The beast is heading for Camelot.
It's fast and agile, but big enough to hit and to hit hard.
Starting today on training routines, we'll concertrate on an attack strategy.
We do nt have much time.
Is there anything I can do, sire?
I knwo in the event of battle, only a knight may serve.
That's correct and you are not yet a knight, which is why I'm bringing your test forward.
You can face me in the morning.
Well, here we are - your final challenge.
Succeed and you join the elite.
Lancelot, fifth son of Lord Eldred of Northumbria your time starts now.
Do you submit, sire?
Arise, Sir Lancelot, Knigh of Camelot.
Who is this man?
He seems to have come out of nowhere.
You do us a great honour, Sir Lancelot.
The knighthood is the very foundation of Camelot.
The honour is all mine, sire.
You father would be very proud.
I've not seen Lord Eldred for many years, longer than I'd imagined it seems.
Last time I saw him, he only had four sons.
And I've kept you too long already.
Take this seal to Geoffrey of Monmouth, the court genealogist.
Look at him, Gaius.
Dose Lancelot not deserve this moment?
I never said he did n't.
You played God, Merlin.
You set him on a path of your choosing.
You brought him triumph but the future is uncertain.
I do nt know what it said in you invitation, but in mine, it said celebration.
Do n't come back too late.
Yes sire, I do.
Yeah, I suppose she is.
I think our Sir Lancelot might have eyes for you, Gwen.
Would it be so bad?
He's not really my type.
Well, there's a surprise.
Sometimes I wonder if you'd know your type, if he was standing right next to you.
So come on - just for the sake of argument, if you had to, Arthur or Lancelot?
I do n't have to and I never will.
Oh, you are no fun, Gwen.
Ladies and gentlemen, please join me in a toast to our new recruit, our new knight of Camelot, Sir Lancelot.
Two yards of ale?
Two miles, more like.
Do nt smell it, just down it in one.
Ca n't have you nodding off first day on the job, Lancelot.
Sir Lancelot, if you do nt mind.
Tell him what you told me.
These credentials are faked.
The seal itself is faultless.
Forgery of the highest possible standard, but a forgery it must be.
There is no record of a fifth son of Lord Eldred of Northumbria.
- Therefore, he
Do you deny it?
You've broken the first code of Camelot.
You've brought shame upon yourself and upon us.
You're not worthy of knighthood.
You never were and you never will be.
Get him out of my sight.
But he meant no harm, sire. I'm sure of it.
He only wished to serve.
The first code is a sacred bond of trust.
It is what binds the knights together.
How can you trust a man who's lied to you?
I do n't know what to say to you, Lancelot.
- You're not to blame.
- Yes, I am.
I made you lie.
The choice was mine.
My punishment is mine to bear, and mine to bear alone.
I wish there was something I could do.
You can stop blaming yourself.
Whatever you do, you do n't say I told you so.
I have no wish to gloat.
What's done is done.
Here, come and take a look at this.
I've realised my mistake.
I've been looking for the creature in the wrong place,
The records of all known living things in the kingdom.
What about creatures only recorded in legend? In myth?
And I just discovered this.
You said your knights were the best in the land.
All I know is it's still out there.
The kingdom has been menaced by this creature for too long.
We finish this now.
Sire, if I may?
I've researched this creature, sire.
I believe it to be a griffin.
What's in a name?
Griffin is a creature of magic.
I do n't have time for this, physician.
It is born of magic, sire, and it can only be killed by magic.
It's a creature of flesh and blood like any other.
Arthur proved that today.
I'm not so sure, father.
I think there may be some truth in what he says.
Our weapons were useless against it.
The next time will be its last.
When will your knights be ready to ride again?
An hour, maybe two.
We finish this tonight.
Is it true... that the griffin can only be killed by magic?
I'm certain of it.
If Arthur rides out against it, he'll die.
Then he must be stopped.
Uther must see reason.
Where magic is concered, our king is blind to reason.
And yet, magic is our only hope.
You're not suggesting...
It is your destiny, Merlin.
The true purpose of your magic.
You saw it, Gaius.
I ca n't go up against that thing.
But if you do not, then Arthur will surely perish.
I do n't have magic that powerful.
This's the only way.
Do you even care what's happening to me?
Kill the griffin, Merlin!
I just sit here warm my feet by fire
I would give my life for you without a thought.
I ca nt save Arthur.
It is not my destiny.
I do nt know what else I can say.
Then I'll say it for you.
We have two hours to find a way to kill that thing.
I should have known.
How could I have been so stupid?
You do n't look like a knight!
Because you fight like a knight.
- We could not kill it.
I have never faced its like.
I faced it myself, sire.
Some days past. I struck it full square.
I wondered how it endured.
There are those that believe this creature, this griffin, Is a creature of magic, that only magic can destroy it.
Do you believe this?
It does nt matter what I believe, the use of magic is not permitted.
The knights must prevail with steel and sinew alone.
There's a horse waiting outside.
No, please, it's not my freedom I seek.
I only wish to serve with hornour.
Then let me ride with you.
My father knows nothing of this.
I release you, but can do no more.
Now go before I change my mind.
You must do this for Arthur.
I've never cast a spell of enchantment this powerful.
You have it within you.
We've plenty of time.
Sorry to disturb you, my lady.
Lancelot, What are you doing here?
There's no time, I need weapons, armour.
I must do what I can to protect him.
It's my duty, knight or not.
You really believe that, do nt you?
Lancelot, I do n't believe I've ever met your like before.
Guinevere, if I should not return...
But go I must.
Do nt worry, Merlin, I know you're trying.
Lancelot's ridding out to kill the griffin!
No, you're not.
Try and stop me.
You're not a soldier.
Arthur needs all the help he can get.
It's now or never.
You did it, my son.
Not I, Father.
Father, I can explain.
You have no right to...
What are they doing?
I confess it, sire.
I released him. I'll take the consequences.
But surely Lancelot's actions change things.
He broke the code.
He laid down his life for me!
He served with honour.
I see you feel strongly about this, Arthur.
Under the circumstances, a pardon, perhaps.
Not good enough, Father.
You must restore Lancelot to his rightful place,
As a knight of Camelot.
The code bends for no man!
Then the code is wrong!
They'll restore your knighthood, of course they will.
You killed the griffin.
Your secret's safe with me.
But I can not take credit for what I did not do.
There'll be no more lies.
The only thing I can do.
I'll hear him.
Forgive me, sire.
I've come to bid you farewell.
I lied to you both, and now there is conflict between you.
I can not bear that burden, as you should not bear mine.
I must start again, far from here.
Then maybe one day fate shall grant me another chance,
To prove myself a worthy knight of Camelot.
But, Lancelot, you've already proved that to us.
But I must prove it to myself.
Your Highness. Prince Arthur.
Perhaps you were right, Gaius.
I should never have got involved.
Lancelot needed you and you needed Lancelot.
Will he ever return?
That I can not say.
Till next time, then...
My name is Edwin Muirden and I have a remedy to cure all ills.
We can not preserve her life for much longer.
She has hours, maybe less.
I wonder what Uther will do.
Probably have him burnt.
There's 4 of you.
Never change the deal.
Well, this is a new deal.
So we'll stop and get more gas!
Every exposure... increases the risk of getting caught.
An extra 80 kilos means the Koni shock absorbers... I installed for this job will not give us... the ability to outmaneuver... any police that might be chasing us.
Which means, if there is a chase... we lose our advantage, which also increases... the possibility of getting caught.
I do n't want to get caught.
You do n't want to get caught.
And who's going to drive?
Not without the ignition code you wo n't.
3 men. 254 kilos.
See what I mean about the shocks?
Now it's time.
Move it, Marcel, move it!
We're going the wrong way!
Stop it, Marcel, stop!
Look out, look out! Whoa!
Take us to the drop point!
What are you doing?
Do n't stop now!
Come on, do something!
What are you thinking?
Your gun, please.
I'm fed up with this car chase!
You gave me too much.
We need you to take us to Avignon.
The deal was this far and no further.
Rules are meant to be broken.
Oh, yeah, well, how come... you do n't have your yellow card with you?
Yeah, they all say that.
"Left it back in Nam on the base." Uh - huh.
Let me show you what we do to people... who left it back in Nam on the base.
Please let go of me!
You gotta be punished for not carrying... your shot record on you.
The Argentinian government reaffirmed... it s commitment to meeting... the I.M. F's target this year.
And yesterday, in Nice... 4 men robbed the Alliance Investment Corporation.
One man died on the sidewalk.
The others were apprehended early this morning... when they took a wrong turn on a one - way street... in Avignon and ran into a taxi cab.
The police said... were it not for their poor driving habits... the 20 million euros in bearer bonds... would have been cashed and gone by this afternoon.
And in other news...
I'd say that's probably true, Inspector.
You have a good sense of humor... for a foreigner, Monsieur Frank.
Just the right amount of flavor.
Until they pass a law that says I ca n't.
You want to come in for a coffee?
Uh, thank you... but I have a lot of stops to make.
That's a lot of stops.
Oh, it's a very popular car... with a certain type down here.
You've seen them.
They come over from Italy... in those very expensive suits... and the young pretty girls... with the big jewelry and too much make - up.
There was a robbery.
By someone in a 1999 black BMW 735?
With 06 on the plate.
You have been in the city lately?
Not for a while.
The food... the way they grill fish.
No place else in France does it... the way they do in Nice.
I prefer the women there.
I do n't particularly like complicated.
You like to keep it simple.
Why are you so interested?
Oh, you know, uh... ever since I'm a little boy... military people have always intrigued me.
I'm an ex-little boy.
Sure you do n't have time for a coffee?
Everything is always... so neat with you, Monsieur Frank.
I'll take that as a compliment... coming from a man who pays attention to every detail.
Maybe I'll come back later for that coffee.
Door's always open to you.
Lupo gave me your number.
I'm looking for a transporter.
One bag, that's it.
One meter fifty by half meter.
50 kilos, not more.
You're delivering to Mister...
7:00 in the morning at the front door.
A package, one meter fifty by fifty... 50 kilos, 250 kilometers... travelling within the speed limit... one stop for refreshments... 40,000.
Half now, half on delivery.
Delivery will be at noon.
If no one's there, it is not my responsibility.
I'll leave the package.
Once we make a deal... the terms of that deal can not be changed... or renegotiated.
It's rule number one.
Transportation is a precise business.
Now, do n't move.
I'm not gonna hurt you.
I'm just gonna make a little hole... so you can drink.
That's all I'm gonna do.
OK, OK, that's enough.
I'm going to take the tape off.
If you scream, I'll have to kill you.
You want me to do it in your car?
It's to cut you free.
You do n't need your mouth to pee.
You have one minute.
You're breaking the rules, Frank.
Not good to break the rules.
Do n't make me drag you out.
Never look in the package.
Hope you enjoyed your pee... because it's your last on this trip.
Ran into a little problem.
You open the package?
Never open the package.
You ca n't get anything done in the world without rules.
You're a foreigner, right?
High class, good reputation.
I did n't get your name.
You do n't count it?
You know, I was wondering... if you would n't mind... transporting something for me.
That's what you do, right?
Oh, maybe a kilo.
I know, you wanna pee.
All you wanna do is pee.
Just keep it simple.
My name is Lai.
You want to try again?
I wo n't say any...
I ca n't think straight when I'm tired.
I always see things better.
Hey... are you comfortable?
The transporter's dead.
You told them nothing, right?
Let's keep it that way.
I picked them from the garden outside.
I hope you do n't mind.
I did n't know if you like coffee... or tea, so I made both.
I like it quiet in the morning.
Quiet in the morning.
I'm the same way.
I like very quiet.
Are you looking for milk?
There's milk at the door.
Is Monsieur Frank in?
Is your invitation for coffee still open?
Sure, come on. Please, sit.
I'll bring some more.
My mother used to make... fresh madeleines every morning.
I smell them and my whole childhood... comes back in one big flood... like Proust.
You ever read Proust, Monsieur Frank?
Memory like a steel trap.
He would have been a great cop.
A real detail man.
I used to have a memory like Proust.
Like a filing cabinet up there.
I would see something and remember it like that.
Like, uh, license plates.
I could see a plate and it was printed in my head.
Now I need all the help I can get... remembering whose plate... goes with whose car.
Like, uh, this one.
Where's the rest of the car?
I was hoping you could tell me.
- It was stolen.
Yeah, I went down to Frejus to pick up a few things.
Did you report it?
It's the first on my list of things to do today.
It's a long walk from Frejus.
How did you get home?
Mm, a risky thing.
Picking up a stranger on a dark road.
He had a kind face.
I did n't see a car outside.
It's in the garage.
May I see it?
Pretty nice car for a cook.
Some people have a problem with the Germans.
They take up the best beaches in summer.
They ca n't cook worth a damn.
I would say your intuition worked out very well... for Monsieur Frank, mademoiselle.
Worked out for both of us.
My intuition says this is probably a good time... for me to go file my report.
Where's the rest of my car?
It was blown to pieces at a rest stop.
What's left of it is down at the lab.
They're trying to separate what was left... of the 2 cops in the trunk... from the rest of it.
But, uh, you would n't know anything about that?
Thank you for the coffee and the memories.
Come back any time.
Would you mind walking me?
Less work for Mother.
But this business at the rest stop.
That is not very quiet.
I do n't suppose you would like to tell me... something besides a stolen car story?
If I had one I would.
Well, may I suggest that when the 2 of you... show up in my office after lunch... you do have one.
A better one than you currently have.
You are the one he wants to see... not me!
Please, I have to think.
You were supposed to think last night.
Yeah, well, last night I had nightmares... about a girl who came into my nice, quiet life... screwed it all up.
I'm still wondering if I want to know everything... or nothing about you.
No, do n't stay there!
Come on, give me your hand!
Come on, get in!
Come on, you wanna die?
Calm down, OK?
Is this your house?
I should mind my own goddamn business.
A simple, little rule.
There's gotta be some dry clothes... in this house.
Do n't open the package.
Nothing but trouble, you open the goddamn package.
Making up for the trouble.
I do n't like it when things get complicated.
You like things simple.
I'm not so clear about the house.
After you left, we went for a walk on the beach.
Did you see anybody else swimming?
So, you took a walk, had a swim... on a beach where no one else was swimming... past the point where you ca n't see... or be seen from the beach on either side... which makes witnesses a little hard to come by.
That's the point of a romantic swim.
Then we came back to the house... found it on fire.
And the 5,000 rounds of spent ammo... my men found all around the house?
Maybe they had the wrong house.
Monsieur Frank... people with this kind of firepower... do not make mistakes about who they visit.
Who would want you this dead?
Any problems with a client?
I do n't have clients.
I live on my army pension, you know that.
You have all the facts of who I am... and who I was.
You've had them for years.
Any enemies you can think of?
People from the past?
I left the past behind when I moved here.
I'll just be a moment.
What are you doing?
You just need a password.
What, are you nuts?
We're in a police station.
Except when we make love.
So, where will you be staying?
Well, my cousin has a small hotel.
Thanks, but we'll manage.
Without money, it would be hard.
It's not much... but at least you wo n't go hungry.
Going to see that guy.
You're not coming?
I'll buy a new one.
He burned your house.
I'll rebuild it.
He tried to kill you!
And as far as he knows, he succeeded.
Look, I'm going to give you some advice.
I do n't know what you were into.
I do n't care what you were into.
But whoever wanted you dead... thinks you're dead.
There are 400 people dying... in a container on a ship.
The ship arrives today.
They will make my father a slave.
The only one who knows the container number... is that guy.
The moment you saw those pictures in my house... you were setting me up to get involved in this.
Not everything is a lie.
Name one thing that is n't?
What happened in the house... between us... that was not a lie.
Your job was to save people.
This time... I care.
No phone calls for half an hour?
Put your hands where I can see'em.
I have one question for you.
Why'd you try to kill me?
You lied to me.
You opened the package.
You broke the rules.
What's the ship number?
I wo n't answer any more... so I suggest you kill me right now... and go screw yourself.
I ca n't find anything.
Oh, poor Frank.
We're smuggling people in containers?
I tell you, "Lai" 's the perfect name for her.
Mr. Kwai's on the way up.
Your father's here.
He'll really get a kick out of this.
I thought your father was in a container.
I mean, no.
There are 400 people in that container.
Stay where you are!
She's a real heartbreaker, is n't she, Frank?
10 seconds, 2 choices.
The information on the paper or your brains on the desk!
Now tell me I'm lying!
Lai, give me the gun.
I do n't know what you're talking about.
Would I kill my own daughter?
She thinks we're smuggling people in containers.
I do n't know where you get these ideas!
Would you kill your own father?
Please... I am begging you.
I do what I do.
I'll never change.
But if you do n't... get this gun out of my face!
I know he's innocent.
Oh, you have such a good heart.
Always interested in saving innocent people.
Well, here's your big chance.
Drop your gun... and you will save one.
I need him to wrap something up.
Just for the record... there are n't 400 people in that container.
Am I glad you're here.
This man used my partner's daughter here... to try and blackmail us.
Luckily, my security got the drop on him.
kidnapping... extortion, assault.
Well, I suppose in your business... you have to know all types.
Now, should I call my lawyer?
We'll handle it.
I'll expect all of you... down at my office to give your statements.
As soon as I contact my lawyer... we'll be more than happy to oblige.
The doctor said you will have a headache... for a few days and then everything... will go back to normal.
Ah, I think you should be more concerned... with where you are.
Oh, well, with the charges they filed... you will not be getting out... for a very long time.
Assaulting a distinguished member... of the international business community... kidnapping his daughter... extortion.
I'm sorry, Frank.
I would like to help you... but if you continue with the same old story...
"I am retired, living on a pension..."
For once, I need the truth.
They're smuggling people.
From Asia through Marseilles... in containers.
You know this for fact?
"Never believe the cook."
She's not the cook.
You know, Frank... no one is perfect.
So you're saying you're gonna do nothing?
No, I'm saying...
I'm going to start an investigation.
And in the meantime, the 400 people... in that container could be dead already.
But what am I supposed to do?
At least with me, it does n't take 12 months... to get the job done.
Oh, yes, I know.
That's what I admire about you, Frank.
All that army training... all that sneaking around... a man like you could probably resolve this case... in, how long?
You would be the perfect man for the job.
Yes... if I were out.
Yes... if you were out.
Anybody moves and I kill him.
If this is how you transport... I'm amazed you get any work at all.
Come on and give me a hand.
Maybe I should go with you?
Thanks, but, uh, I'm better alone.
That is a very small boat... to fight a very big war.
But it's a good boat.
The shipment's cleared.
Here's the paperwork.
Go straight to the warehouse.
We'll be right behind you just in case.
OK, we are ready to go.
I spent thousands of dollars... for you to go to school and learn English.
The least you can do is speak it.
I'm still your father.
Get her out of here!
I'm looking to do a little sightseeing.
This plane is not for tourists.
I'm not a tourist.
Call this guy and tell him to meet me.
- No, Dad, stop!
Hands on your head.
If she moves or I do n't return... shoot her!
I'm really not in the mood for a swim.
So, how did a lowlife like you... end up with my daughter?
Is n't that where you left her?
The delivery will be made.
My daughter will get over it.
If I'm lucky, maybe she'll see the light.
Yeah, if she's lucky maybe you'll get hit by a truck.
What do you know?
I know she'll never stop being who she is... and she'll never be you or anything like you.
She'll come around... but you wo n't be here to see it.
I guess she wo n't be coming around after all.
I'd rather see it coming.
Makes no difference to me.
Pretty impressive timing, Frank.
Mom was right about you!
- You're my sister and I do love you!
- What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Cameron, get up, I'm leaving soon.
- Cameron, get up, now!
- I've been planning this retreat for months, the least you could've done is gotten up early and helping out around here.
- I do n't want eggs.
- Angie you love eggs.
- Angie, eat it.
- Jesus, Joey, take it.
- You guys stop, enough, take this.
Now, Cameron, I need help packing!
- Oh, my God. Geez, why am I getting yelled at?
Uncle Joey does n't do anything around here.
- What the hell is his problem?
For the same reason she lets us live here, we're family.
- One minute, Mom.
- Eliza, I ca n't find my pills.
Will you please help me finish packing?
And get my sleeping bag from the cellar?
Uncle Cameron, I have something to show you.
I told you, I'm working on it.
Why does n't Grandma like Mom?
She just does n't want you around her when she's sick.
I made a painting for Mom.
- Where is the baby going?
I'm trying to grab his hand to stop him from going to heaven.
Do you remember your twin brother?
Well, it's beautiful, and your mom's gonna love it.
For the last time, I do n't want Angie around her, move!
Mom, she has the right to see her real mother.
- Did you forget you're an alcoholic?
I've been sober for 12 years.
Yeah, well, Mom, when you were getting sober you still had the right to see us.
Cameron, I was drinking, Caitlin's a junkie!
So those mistakes make her less fit to be a mom than you?
Oh, that's it, move, this discussion is over.
- Hey, someone's cranky.
Listen, I pray for Caitlin, I do.
But I lost one grandchild because of her, and I'm not gonna lose another, okay?
Listen, Uncle Joey said that he'd help with Angie, all right, so no fighting, promise?
You trust douchebag Uncle Joey with Angie but not Caitlin?
Stop in, and Aunt Jean is gonna come this weekend, check in, all right?
- What am I, five?
Besides, it'll give you the night off, okay?
- You worry too much.
- I worry too much?
Come here, give me a hug, I'm an expert at it.
I'll miss you, be good.
Yeah, I wo n't burn down the house or kill anybody or anything, so.
I love you too, Mom.
- Come find me, Uncle Cameron!
- Hey, let me out!
- Give me one good reason to let you out.
Now, Uncle Cameron!
When you go to college, who's gonna come find me here?
Looks like I'm not going to college.
- Are you ready to go see Momma?
- But Grandma said we ca n't go.
I'm in charge now, and I say it's okay.
But if you say one word, though, lady.
Where are you taking her?
I'm taking her to the zoo.
Trying to stay on track and keep going to work.
- What's going on over there?
- There's been awful fights all week.
- Did you call the cops?
In this neighborhood, there's really no point.
Around here, it's better to mind your own business.
Uncle Cameron, do n't go!
- Get her away, man!
- You're letting him get away.
What the hell are you doing here?
He was the last one!
- What happened, just tell me what happened.
I'm here to help!
- Are you bleeding?
- This is all your fault.
- I ca n't believe you let him get away.
- My sister is calling the cops.
- I have to save my baby.
- We're here to help!
Let me help you!
- What's wrong with her?
- She'll be okay.
Listen, let's let the cops deal with this one.
What if she caught whatever that baby had?
You better get out ta here.
- Just call me, okay?
All right, take her. Come on, baby.
Where's your mother?
Nanny, she went on a retreat.
Let me help you.
Oh, not the comforter, it's too hot.
- If you need anything else...
- I want a good night kiss from Angie.
Hand me my book, honey.
- Take care of Angie, Cam.
Yeah, and you were n't there, I'm telling you.
Do n't be so dramatic.
You sound like your mom.
I swear, I heard something coming up, like from under the bed.
That's what you get for smoking this.
I've been a bit preoccupied around here.
God, you're making excuses again.
- Look, I told you I'd think about it.
- This is our future, Cameron.
- I know, Megan.
- You graduated a year ago.
You wanna end up like your uncle, or your mom?
Come on, how long are you gonna wait to start your own life?
- What, Cam, what the hell?
Oh, you know you need to be in bed.
I'm not doing this right now.
Angie, come on. Get out of there!
You should've seen the look in Angie's eyes.
Do you have any idea how insane that sounds?
I mean, seriously, you probably just smoked something that you should n't have.
Okay, can we talk about your hallucinations later please?
Angie's gonna be just fine.
The doctor said that I just need you to watch her, okay?
I know you're in there.
- Come on. I gotta talk to you.
Please. It's my niece.
- I have nothing to say to you.
- No, help me, please.
Listen, whatever the reason is you hate me, do n't take it out on my niece.
She's just a little girl.
All you need to know, is in here.
- They were chosen, so that a child could be saved.
Their deaths were wasted, they always are.
She dares you to try, but she knows. You will fail.
Who are you talking about?
She's the child - stealer, her name is Lilith.
She was Adam's first wife.
What do you mean, Adam and Eve, Adam?
Her womb was cursed.
She would never bear children.
So what are you telling me is that Lilith has Angie?
- There's still time to save her.
You need to offer six other lives to Lilith in little Angie's place, six lives from her bloodline, from your family.
What do you want me to do?
Are you expecting me to kill them?
Lilith does the taking.
﻿You have six days to mark six members of the blood line.
And if you fail, Angie will be gone.
- Where is your baby?
- I almost saved him.
And then you showed up.
- You let my ex-husband escape.
- He would've been the last.
- I wish you were dead, and not my boy.
But I ca n't stand the thought of that little girl going through the same thing.
I spent three days trying to understand this. I wasted time on doctors, PIs, paranormal experts.
Everything I could think of to save my baby.
Three of my six days, and now he is gone.
You do n't have time.
- I'm not the one who needs help right now.
If I were to choose six people...
- how would I choose'em?
- The first one is unbearable.
And then it gets harder.
Yeah, Mom, I'm here.
No, Angie has just run into fever.
It's nothing too serious.
Yes, Mom, I called Dr. Mendez.
She's in bed already.
She took her pill.
Okay, so what does this book mean?
And where is Nanny, Cameron?
Why wo n't you believe me?
You need to trust me on this one.
Okay, so, Lilith is a demon and you sacrificed Nanny to her?
- I'm not lying, Caitlin.
Caitlin, it wo n't open!
I need a drink.
Caitlin, that's not gonna fix anything.
What we need is five more people, and we only have four days to go.
Okay, well, how do we choose?
Whatever, man, just take it.
I just want you to know, uh, I hope Angie's okay.
I checked on her earlier, she did n't look too good.
You checked on her?
Yeah, I do care, okay?
I mean, we are family, right?
I guess we are.
- Did you check on Nanny?
She said she'd be back soon.
- Where did you come from?
Why are you sleeping?
It's been such a long week.
But you do n't have time to sleep.
Hey, hey, Cam, Cam, wake up!
- So how do we do this?
- I need to see this.
What the... Huh?
He was just lying there, and he just woke up.
- You still had time to make the symbol.
- He was awake, Caitlin.
I do n't see you volunteering to cut your finger - and eternally damn your family members.
I'm not gonna lose Angie, Cam.
Since when do you care about Angie?
Or did n't you think I would notice?
Wait, I forgot, it's not your fault.
Okay, you have a daughter who loves and adores you.
When Angie needs you the most, you're walking out.
You know maybe Mom was right.
Maybe you do n't deserve Angie.
But you are the one that brought this thing on Angie.
You are the one who put her life in danger.
You are the one who's gonna take care of it.
- That's your reaction?
I'm sorry to inconvenience you, but we have some decisions here.
- I ca n't do this right now, Megan.
- What can be more important than this?
Look, I know you do n't wanna sacrifice your life for a kid.
Megan, you told me you were on the pill.
It does n't always work.
It's life and death.
It's not an easy choice.
I wanna keep it.
I ca n't do this right now.
I just need some time.
You missed a button right here.
You're looking sharp today, Grandpa.
Granddad, you must be wondering where Nanny is.
I really wish you were here to help me.
- Can I help you?
But I can help you, Cameron.
Lilith... she's here.
What do you know about Lilith?
She took my little girl.
Sacrifice anyone, no.
I went through six days of hell not knowing. I had a way, a chance.
Lilith was haunting me, mocking me, the whole time.
That's what she does.
Then I became a nun.
- How did you find us?
The book Sabrina gave you, I wrote it.
I've been tracking her for years.
Helping anyone I can.
Trying to find a way to banish the unholy beast back to hell.
Have you managed to offer her anyone?
So she was pretty much already dying when I found her.
Or maybe you do have some stones after all.
But three days down, you're gonna have to push harder.
A nun is encouraging me to kill my own family?
All of us are marked by years. By bad habits.
Mediocre deaths and the ease of it come into our petty lives.
Greatness can be written there.
That still makes me a killer.
- Aunt Jean, Randy.
- I thought you guys were coming tomorrow.
Hosting a women's luncheon, last minute, now tomorrow, so... as promised to your mother, I'm checking in.
Is this a bad time?
No, no, well, maybe a little bit.
Where's your grandmother, upstairs?
- She's out.
Not gonna ask about my brother, but what about little Angie?
She's sick and she's in bed.
It's just the cold.
- I am so susceptible to colds.
- Would you guys like something to drink?
Orange juice, some warm milk?
Uncle Joey has beer.
If your mom would've married into money like mine did, you might better off, but my mom's a total milf, so.
I do n't wanna think of Aunt Jean like that.
Oh, come on, your mom is totally doable.
So must be tough getting laid living in your grandma's house.
Well, I have a girlfriend, so, not really.
- Yeah, give me a minute.
- I'm in Angie's room.
Hide your drugs in Angie's room?
Look, man, it's nothing personal.
You know, opportunity's knock and what not, so.
If you jump out at me and scare me I will pepper spray both of you.
I swear to God, guys, one more time and I'm gonna kill you.
Jesus Christ, Cameron! Are you trying to give me a heart attack?
- Aunt Jean's dead.
- Caitlin, I ca n't do this alone.
Randy's tied up in the cellar.
She did n't take him.
I should start figuring out how to do Uncle Joey.
You'll be with Nanny.
You'll be happier.
Jesus, what am I doing.
You're doing what's necessary to save Angie.
Your guilt is the only thing that's stopping you from saving her!
He'll understand, you know.
- You have to.
That's easy for you to say.
You do n't have to choose six people over one little girl.
Do n't ever tell me what I would or would not do to save my Rebeca.
And you're a fool.
A fool who's squandering the only chance you're ever gonna get.
There is no good option here.
Even God knows what you have to do.
There's no going back.
So snap out of it, grow some balls and do what you have to do.
I know he's old.
And sick, and he probably does n't have much time left, but... he's still a good ma... a good man.
Do n't bother screaming, nobody's here.
Here, I bought you this, it's a protein shake.
What you saw upstairs was a demon taking your mom.
No, man, I totally understand.
If you let me go I can help.
Sorry, I ca n't do that.
All right, and my mom, she's important, she's got stuff going on like every minute.
You do n't think people are gonna notice?
You never shut up, do you?
Angie, Angie, you're up?
Angie, what are you doing?
- Can I go see her?
I'll go check on Grandpa.
I did n't think you cared.
Well, that much I mean.
Well, Nanny will be back from Aunt Jean's tomorrow.
You know Aunt Jean.
- Ah, bet gone bad.
You're family, it means something.
This is insane, we ca n't just page through our family photo albums and figure out who should die.
- And what about Granddad?
Granddad is gonna be a natural choice.
But he has to go after Uncle Joey.
Or else Uncle Joey is gonna be way too suspicious, and I'm running out of excuses on why people are n't around anymore.
I really do n't think you need to worry about Uncle Joey,
I do n't know what's been going on lately... but he's a lot more...
Which is kinda messed up because... it sure would be a lot easier if I still thought he was a useless asshole.
Okay, yeah, Dad's already on the list, but he's out of town, and I do n't have time to track him down.
Okay, what about his kids?
They're blood related to Angie.
I'm not killing kids.
Then who are the last two, Cameron?
I think we got a problem.
He thinks that Angie is gonna be taken by some demon.
He tried to kill me.
- Get me out!
- Over here, dumbass!
- Over here, Caitlin.
We ca n't just leave him tied up down here.
- Okay, well, we are until this is all over.
- He almost got away already.
Cameron, I have a really big problem with this.
Caitlin, I'm doing what I have to do to save your daughter.
- Where is everybody, Mom?
- You're home early.
- Wait, what is this.
- No, you're not fine.
- No, come here!
Honey, what's the matter?
If you had to choose between Angie and Caitlin, one of'em had to die, who would you choose?
- What kind of question is that?
Is there something wrong with Angie?
This sounds crazy, Cameron.
I do n't understand any of this.
What have you been doing?
Mom, listen to me.
I made some awful choices, but it's because I had to.
- This is all to save Angie.
- Wait, what choices are you talking about?
What have you done?
Save Angie from what, Cameron?
What've you been doing?
Cameron, what are you doing?
The devil has come to this house.
This is my fault.
I knew that I'd be called to the gates of hell one day for what I did.
What are you talking about?
When the twins were born Jamie came out with all those problems, he was so sick.
He went so peacefully.
What did you do to Jamie?
I took his frail life away with these evil hands.
- You killed my baby?
Get away from me.
Get away from me!
For three years you've had Angie because I was called an unfit mother.
And you kicked me out of my home, and you would n't call me, you took my children, and you killed my Jamie!
I made the wrong choice, I'm so sorry.
That was n't your choice to make.
Wild cats and hyenas will meet there, and billy goats called to each other,
Lilith the night monster will lurk there and find herself a place to rest.
Nanny gave this to me.
I want you to have it.
- Randy's tied up in the cellar.
I tried the symbol on him, it did n't work.
We gotta go right now.
I love you so much, Cameron.
I want you to know I always loved you.
Take care of Angie.
We have our last sacrifice.
Oh, my God, Angie.
Cam, what happened to you?
- I need something from you.
I wanna be a good father.
And I do n't wanna keep this baby.
- What the hell is going on?
Let me go, please let me go!
- This is n't my baby, is it?
Come on, honey,
- You guys are crazy.
- You have no idea what you've done.
I promised Mom we'd finish this.
We are finishing this.
- Should do the same?
She is your daughter!
I am her mother.
You're a murderer.
Oh, I can take care of Angie better than any murderer!
- You ca n't even take care of yourself.
You're gonna be put away, what are you gonna do for her?
They'll find her a decent home.
One with a mom who is n't shooting up.
Baby, come here.
What makes you think... that you deserve to live and she deserves to die?
I'm still here, and I have a right to fight for my life.
- I do n't feel good, Mommy.
Help me draw the symbol on myself.
There is no time, come over here.
Help me draw the symbol on myself.
Tell me, promise me, Caitlin.
Caitlin, Caitlin, go!
Ready to go, sweetie?
So now the plan is either find ourselves a new counselor, stick it out with the old one, but go more often, or resign ourselves to the fact that she's never gonna be happy... no matter what I do, so let's take the money we're wasting and put it towards a membership at Lakeview.
I'm guessing the last option has yet to be formally presented.
You usually run half speed to stay with me.
How are things with Elyse?
You're either out of breath, or you're lying to me.
Yeah. We have our moments, but they usually work out.
Man, you got some water?
So how do you work things out?
I do n't know. We talk, someone apologizes.
Man, I should n't have drank last night.
- Hey, you mean you apologize.
You do it this morning?
Maybe that's why you ca n't stand up, huh?
Sleeping Beauty, wake up.
Come on. It's almost 4:00.
Tell him I'm not feeling well.
It's Saturday. You have n't been to work in three days.
Just let me sleep.
You have n't been out of bed since Wednesday.
No. Leave me alone.
I think there's something wrong with me.
She's been averaging 18 hours of sleep a day since her admission.
Every time I'm around one of them, I get blue.
It's not clinical depression.
Great. Got it all figured out.
You do n't need me.
Three E.R. doctors, two neurologists and a radiologist have all figured out what it's not.
We need to figure out what it is.
If any of the above - mentioned doctors... were interested in my opinion, they would have asked for it.
None of them are willing to subject themselves to you.
No pain, no gain.
The blood work shows no signs of inflammation, and no one can figure out what's actually the cause -- Ah.
I did n't realize it was possible for a woman to be unusually irritable.
Nice try, but you're a misanthrope, not a misogynist.
What's the first thing you ask a doctor who's referring a patient?
Are you questioning my ability to take a history?
What's the primary -- Not "What." "Why?".
Diseases do n't have motives.
Give me the chart.
I find your interest interesting.
She's irritable and sleeping 18 hours a day.
What's interesting about that?
Hypersomnia's usually accompanied by irritability in depressed patients.
True, but not relevant.
She's sleeping 18 hours a day.
Clinical depression does not cause fever.
- She could be sick and depressed.
- She's sick.
Why did n't I think of that?
- Yeah, that's what I meant.
Hypersomnia and personality changes point toward the brain.
Could this be a brain problem?
But the patient's never been outside of the United States -- especially the tropics.
- You mean she claims she's never been outside the U.S.
Blood and C.S.F. smears show no sign of parasites.
- A tumor sitting directly on top of the brain stem... that three E.R. doctors, two neurologists and a radiologist missed?
Redo the blood work, and get a new M.R.I. with two - millimeter cuts through the mesodiencephalic.
And check for evil stepmothers.
This much sleep usually indicates poison apples.
Anything else besides the shortness of breath?
- Eight hours a day.
- I teach preschool.
Any history of heart disease in your family?
Been under a lot of stress lately?
No more than usual.
You're probably just a little anemic.
Do I need to take this off?
You can just pull that down in front.
- Are those real?
- Do they look real?
They look pretty damn good.
They were a present for my husband's 40th.
But I'm afraid the cause of your problem could be staring us right in the face.
Actually, I guess I'm the one doing the staring.
Ofcourse, I ca n't be sure.
I'd like to consult a colleague.
He's actually somewhat of an expert in these matters.
Can I get a page on Dr. Wilson?
- We're checking just to be safe.
- Y'all already checked for that.
Some tumors are almost impossible to see unless you know exactly where to look.
- That means it would be small, right?
Then you'd be able to operate, take it out?
If it's a tumor, there are a variety of treatment options, but there are variables other than just size.
Try to remain as still as possible.
The less distortion there is, the more detail we'll be able to see.
Well. That's what breasts look like.
Is a lie a lie if everybody knows it's a lie?
Well, if a tree pretends to fall in a forest -- House, come on.
They're a birthday present, not a philosophical treatise.
She did not do that for her husband. She did that for herself.
She thinks if she looks different, she'll be more attractive, which I have to say --
Not to her husband.
Cosmetic surgery is so everyone else will look at us differently.
The same reason you're wearing that tie.
That was gonna be my next point.
Last three months, same five ties.
Thursday should be that paisley thing.
It's a gift from my wife.
No, it's not.
You bought that yourself.
You want to look pretty at work.
Wilson's got a girlfriend.
It takes two department heads to treat shortness of breath?
I want an E.K.G. and blood tests, including tox screen on Mrs. --
- Exam Room One.
- You're ordering tests to cover your lechery.
- Very tricky case.
There were no lesions and no mass effect that we could see.
It means we're still not sure what's causing the neurological problems.
I know some things are hard to cure, but what I just do n't get is why it's taking so long to figure out what's wrong with her.
- I know you're scared. I would be too.
- I do n't feel good.
Honey, are you all right?
Get her on her side.
- I need some Ativan!
- She's having a seizure.
Come on, Elyse.
That we were able to detect. - It's not a tumor.
A small glioma could hide from contrast.
We could do a PETscan.
That's how a responsible doctor would waste his time in this situation.
Suddenly tests and radiologists are incapable of error?
A glioma not presenting on a contrast M.R.I. would have to be smaller than a grain of sand, which does not a gravely ill person make.
- It could be just postictal disorientation.
- We would have seen improvement by now.
- Late - stage Lyme disease can cause seizures.
- Does the husband care about her?
- He has n't left her bedside.
It also means she does n't have Lyme disease.
What, love conquers all?
Lyme disease initially presents with a rash.
- We've looked at everything else.
Did you look at her breasts?
It could be paraneoplastic.
She have any family history of breast cancer?
Her mother died of it.
The brain, but not the brain.
How can breast cancer cause problems in her brain?
There are molecular similarities between brain cells and tumor cells.
Paraneoplastic syndrome causes the body's own antibodies to get thrown off track.
They end up attacking the brain instead of the tumor.
So, if you do find a tumor, what do you do?
We treat the underlying malignancy.
Once there's no tumor to attack, there's nothing for the antibodies to get confused about.
- If the tumor's treatable.
I'm sorry. I know it's uncomfortable.
At least it'll keep me awake.
I wish people would stop telling me not to worry.
My mom was the same age.
We've been trying to get pregnant for over a year.
Guess we're lucky we did n't.
A lot has changed since your mom died.
The M.R.I. and the mammogram only showed a few benign calcifications.
It's most likely a small - cell tumor.
It's no surprise we're having trouble finding it.
We should do a PET scan.
Start with her lungs, then maybe her bones.
Sometimes it presents with no tumor at all.
- How can a disease caused by a tumor present if there's no tumor?
- It happens -- 12% of cases.
- And how do you treat it if there's no tumor?
Those 12%, no treatment.
They were too busy looking for the tumor -- right till they put the patient in the ground.
- What choice do we have?
- Treat the symptoms.
- So we're just gonna ignore the tumor?
Well, eventually it'll get bigger.
Then it'll be really easy to find.
- One of you needs to check out where she works.
- 'Cause the husband's not sick.
If it's not paraneoplastic, and it is a reaction to some sort of toxin, it's obviously not coming from their home.
Foreman, you do it.
Why are you riding me?
It's what I do.
Yeah. Seems to me.
Well, that rules out the race thing.
Cause you were just as black last week.
How long has Elyse worked here?
The rôtisseur prepares the roasted meats and gravies.
How do you clean your grill?
You say "elbow grease".
Do you use chemical cleaners?
And chefs do n't do the cleaning anyway.
You must spray for roaches and that sort of thing.
My kitchen is clean.
I need to get back to work.
So the fact that I'm here asking you these questions, it does n't worry you?
Look at me. I'm here 18 hours a day.
I use the same detergents for 15 years, and everyone is healthy as a horse.
Whatever Elyse has, she did n't get here.
And I had to get a new rôtisseur.
I told him I'd stay up here in case you woke up.
You must have better things to do.
- You're not married?
Waiting for the perfect guy?
You've already found him.
He threw my towels out the window.
That's how we met.
Freshman year, Ed came to a party that my roommate and I threw.
He spent most of the night on the bathroom floor.
He figured I would n't notice the vomit on the towels if I did n't have any towels.
I'm assuming he came back the next day to apologize?
I had to track him down.
Conflict resolution has never been one of Ed's strong points.
Nobody's perfect, right?
Oh, my neck hurts.
You've been in this bed for a really long time.
We're gonna do the same test we did last night, okay?
Do you know what day it is?
It's probably a mild skin irritation.
- Do you know what day it is?
How about I get you that cream right now?
Get'em off of me!
- Get'em off me!
Get'em off me!
- Elyse, calm down.
- Get them off me!
- Elyse, calm down. Calm down.
They're biting me!
I'm gonna need some Haldol, five milligrams.
- Honey, what's wrong?
- Get'em off!
There's nothing there, Elyse.
They're biting me.
You gave sedatives to a patient who's already sleeping 18 hours a day?
It was better than letting her scratch all the skin off her arms.
- Creepy - crawlies are consistent with paraneoplastic syndrome.
There is a simple explanation.
Maybe she really has bugs under her skin.
- That's what a worsening of symptoms after immunotherapy would suggest.
Blood cultures and the timeline rule out most bacteria.
Patient throws up on your shoes, do you clean up most of it?
The symptoms rule out the rest.
Serology rules out viruses.
C.S.F. smears rule out parasites.
In the final stage of African trypanosomiasis almost all the parasites are inside the brain.
It's possible they would n't show on smears.
But it's not possible for a patient who's never been to Africa to have African sleeping sickness.
- I'm just saying it fits the symptoms.
- She could've got it from a transfusion.
- Which she never had.
No, the kitchen she works in is cleaner than some hospitals.
But they do serve rabbit.
Tularemia initially presents with a rash or ulcer near the infection site.
Not if she inhaled it.
Chopping the meat with the cleaver could easily aerosolize the bacteria.
Then she'd have respiratory symptoms.
- Maybe she ignored it, figured she had a cold.
We rejected Lyme disease because the couple would have noticed a rash, but a wet, hacking cough is just gonna slip right by?
Okay, two lousy ideas.
Unfortunately, they're better than all the other ideas.
That's why I ride you.
Stay tuned -- Did he just turn on the TV?
He needs to think.
So this should tell us whether or not she's got rabbit fever?
For a diagnosis of tularemia you need a fourfold increase in serum antibody levels.
To measure an increase you need a before.
- A single titer over 160 would be a big clue.
- "That's why I ride you".
When I have a good idea it's because of him?
Actually, I think he said your idea was a lousy idea.
I say we take our best guess and start treatment. Or treat both.
The treatment for tularemia can cause aplastic anemia.
- How come he does n't ride you guys?
- Got a crush on you.
- He just does n't know how to show it.
- Get over it. He rides everybody.
- The treatment for sleeping sickness kills one in 10 patients.
- We start with the safer treatment.
By "safer", you mean the one that's slightly less likely to kill her.
Foreman got the gang testing for tularemia?
- Probably inconclusive, but worth doing.
So, what's her name?
When do I get to meet her?
- There's nobody.
- Your lips say no.
Well, they're French.
- You ca n't trust a word they say.
- Solid, yet stylish.
A professional woman would be impressed.
I'm thinking accountant.
It's somebody in the hospital.
Chemo's not sexy.
She would certainly have the neediness you need.
I'm not gonna date a patient's daughter.
Ofcourse, most married men would say they do n't date at all.
There was no date.
It's her first time in an oncology unit. She's having a tough time -- emotionally.
- I wanted to be nice.
You always do. It's part of your charm.
Mrs. Campbell's test results.
The preschool teacher with the heart of silicone.
Does n't ring a bell.
They came in yesterday.
I figured you guys would have been all over them.
I know how concerned you were.
She's all upset 'cause we paid more attention to the other girl.
You check out her ass. I've got the chest.
Ofcourse, that's just my opinion.
You might wanna call a couple of guys from maintenance in for a consult.
You check her E.K.G. results before she left the other day?
- You ordered it.
- You're the responsible one.
They look normal to me.
Do I have to get rid of the implants?
But your E.K.G. shows a slightly decreased heart rate.
You told me you had n't changed your diet or exercise.
Does your husband have high blood pressure?
Yeah, you see, if you're gonna repeat everything I say, this conversation's gonna take twice as long.
Yes. He was diagnosed six months ago.
He do a lot of cooking?
Not really, other than oatmeal in the morning.
Did you happen to notice a slightly odd taste to the oatmeal lately?
Are you saying that -- That it looks like your husband... stirred in some of his blood pressure medication along with the brown sugar.
You think my husband's trying to poison me?
I'm guessing he figured if you're both frigid, no harm, no foul.
But if you're still concerned about the shortness of breath, I'd start making your own breakfast.
If you care about your husband at all, I'd do the responsible thing.
Buy yourself some condoms, go to a bar, find --
No. But too bad.
Luckily, I have the answer.
- Thanks for asking.
To life itself: sex.
- It's not without precedent.
A Portuguese man was diagnosed three years ago with C.N.S. - affected sleeping sickness.
His only connection with Africa was through a girlfriend who'd served with the military in Angola.
Where'd you find that?
The Journal of the Instituto de Higiene e Medicina Tropical.
- You do n't read Portuguese?
Pretty sure that's what it said.
Either that or it was an ad for sunglasses.
Her husband has never been to Africa either.
Oh, stymied again.
They're completely devoted to each other.
They love each other.
They're overcompensating for guilt.
- Find out which it is.
- You want me to ask a man whose wife is about to die if he cheated on her?
No, I want you to be polite and let her die.
Actually, I do n't want you to ask her anything.
Foreman, take the husband.
Chase, take the wife.
You do n't trust me to do my job?
We all formulate questions based on the answers we want to hear.
And how exactly do you reformulate "Have you screwed around?"
Did you know she's been trying to get pregnant?
After you got so freaked about the sick babies a while ago, Ifigured that was your thing.
But you've never been prescribed folic acid, and you ca n't lose a baby if you've never been pregnant.
You pulled my medical records?
You coughed the other day. I was concerned.
So it's either, uh, sleeping sickness or this rabbit thing?
They're both fatal without treatment.
Are there tests you can do?
Not at this stage.
But each condition has a unique history.
We're hoping your answers to a few questions will help us.
Sure. Whatever you need to know.
Before the sleeping problems, did you have any trouble breathing, a cough that would n't go away -- anything like that?
I've never been away from her for more than a night.
If she had breathing troubles I would've noticed.
The other condition is significantly more likely if -- if you've had an affair.
Have you ever had an affair?
- I think I'd remember cheating on my wife.
You might be reluctant to admit it.
I just want to be perfectly clear.
If your wife has sleeping sickness, and we do n't treat her, she'll die.
I would never do that to Ed.
They say no cheating, we cross off sleeping sickness.
Okay. We go with Foreman's tularemia.
Start her on I.V. chloramphenicol, 25 milligrams per kilogram, four times a day.
Right next to you.
You have about 20 more days of this fun.
Flow rate looks good.
No rash or flushing.
Do you not remember just asking?
- She fall asleep again?
In the middle of a sentence.
- Patient's not responding.
Elyse, wake up.
- She's unresponsive to pain.
Come on, Elyse.
She's in a coma.
There's only one way a tularemia patient goes into a coma... while on I.V. chloramphenicol.
The patient does n't have tularemia.
And then there was one.
Patient comes in 'cause she's sleeping too much.
It takes 10 doctors and a coma to diagnose sleeping sickness.
And then there was none.
We still have the problem of explaining how a white chick from Jersey who's never traveled south of D.C. has African sleeping sickness.
Still have the obvious explanation.
I made it clear.
If this guy's lying about sleeping around he knows he's murdering his wife.
And waiting for you.
Your wife has human African trypanosomiasis.
You mean it's not tularemia, a virus, tumor or -- or cancer?
I've never had an affair.
And I trust Elyse.
Which is why I need your written consent before I can legally prescribe it.
Why would she lie if she knew it could kill her?
I do n't ask why patients lie.
To protect you, because she did n't think it mattered, it just seemed easier, because... that's what people do.
But if you think there's a possibility that just one time... she was n't perfect -- one weekend you're out of town, one fight where she ran to a friend, one stupid Christmas party -- then you need to allow me to start treatment.
You trust your wife that much?
And special I.V. tubing.
Why do we need this stuff?
Because melarsoprol melts plastic.
This stuff's basically arsenic mixed with antifreeze.
What does n't kill us makes us stronger, huh?
Nietzsche would n't have been so glib if he'd been prescribed melarsoprol.
"Can cause vomiting, abdominal pain, blood toxicity, neural damage, cardiac arrhythmia".
They forgot to say it's gonna hurt like all hell.
She's lucky she's in a coma.
How long before we know if it's working?
It's tough to say.
It's a good sign that she has n't gotten any worse.
Does she even know I'm here?
She knows you're always there for her.
If she gets better, it means she was n't always there for me.
It means she made a mistake.
Part of me -- a big part of me -- ca n't handle that.
It does n't want her to get better.
Does that make me a terrible person?
So you're treating her for African sleeping sickness because you do n't think it's possible for someone to be faithful in a relationship?
And you need to tell me that.
Look. I am not having an affair.
I had lunch with someone I work with -- at work.
I believe you. What I do n't believe is it'll be just once.
I love my wife.
I'm sorry. I know you love your wife.
In fact, you probably love all the women you loved who were n't your wife.
You can be a real jerk sometimes, you know that?
And you're the good guy.
At least I try.
As long as you're trying to be good, you can do whatever you want.
And as long as you're not trying, you can say whatever you want.
So, between us, we can do anything.
We can rule the world.
Mine's a double, senorita.
That's Portuguese, you know.
I'm recalibrating the centrifuge.
It's a very sad thing.
Makes me cry too.
I told the husband he was a jerk.
When I was in college, I -- I fell in love, and I got married.
At that age, the chances of marriage lasting --
It lasted six months.
Thyroid cancer metastasized to his brain.
There was nothing they could do.
I was 21, and...
I watched my husband die.
But that's not the whole story.
It's a symptom, not your illness.
Thyroid cancer would have been diagnosed at least a year before his death.
You knew he was dying when you married him.
It must have been when you first met him.
You ca n't be that good a person and well - adjusted.
Her fever spiked at 104.
Barely 90 over 40.
Did you give her dopamine?
Started 270 micrograms per minute 10 minutes ago.
Killing the parasites is n't gonna do much good if we kill her heart at the same time.
Right now we're killing both.
If she's gonna die, we should at least let her do it without that acid flowing through her veins.
We would've expected your wife's condition to show some improvement by now.
It's going the other way.
What are you gonna do?
Were you always honest with her?
Do you know how lucky you are?
You ca n't love a person and do that to them.
I need to know who you had the affair with.
Why did you lie to us?
You knew your life was at stake.
He's not coming back, is he?
We all make mistakes, and we all pay a price.
I need that name.
Do you know where your dad is?
This town was my home once.
Go far away and never come back.
Every werewolf will be a bundle of fur and sharp teeth tonight whilst your cursed crescent clan will be... Human but only for a few hours and wo n't be again until the next full moon.
You're the wolf who's been watching me.
You were supposed to be my wife.
It's herbs ground into paste.
On the next full moon when your people become human, feed it to them.
The curse will be broken.
I've been hexed, and I do n't know how long I have.
The ancestors said they'd do horrible things to me if I misused my magic again.
Marcellus, you are here by exiled.
If I so much as find a trace of you, it will not end well for you.
Nicely done, brother.
You're beginning to sound like me.
They say the passage of time will heal all wounds...
But the greater the loss, the deeper the cut... And the more difficult the process to become whole again.
The pain may fade, but scars serve as a reminder of our suffering and make the bearer all the more resolved never to be wounded again.
So as time moves along, we get lost in distractions, act out in frustration...
Give in to anger.
All the while, we plot and plan as we wait to grow stronger.
Then before we even realize that so much time has passed...
We are healed, ready to begin anew.
Spoken like a man who's made peace with his demons.
My demons are dead or chased off.
I trust you can find your clothing and the door.
You do recall that... woman tortured our sister?
She also revealed the truth about our sister's treachery.
And as a consequence, Rebekah is gone forever.
A desire which she apparently harbored for quite some time!
Niklaus, it has been a month.
Now I feel our sister's loss as deeply as you, but you must stop distracting yourself with this ridiculous behavior and channel it into some kind of action.
Why must I exactly?
Because over the course of Marcel's tenure, the city grew accustomed to having a King.
You wanted this throne.
Now you must accept the responsibility that accompanies that.
Apologies, but I'm rather ensconced in other pursuits.
If you can so easily neglect your home, I wonder what will become of your daughter.
Have you forgotten what it was like to live beneath the threat of violence?
We must work together, Niklaus.
Let's make this city whole again.
Perhaps it is too broken to mend.
St. Anne's has long been neutral ground in our city, so it's only fitting that we gather in this chamber at the behest of Elijah Mikaelson to bring harmony to this place we call home.
Thank you all for coming.
Yes, thank you, and welcome.
You said if we came along that we would get to run things by ourselves.
While you were each selected to represent your own communities, and I'll honor that.
However, issues which arise between factions, they will come to me.
Now we are all to some extent responsible for the current chaos in the city.
However, you have one very, very simple choice ahead of you here.
You can all play nicely together, or you can leave.
All you have to do is try.
Trying and failing ever since you came back.
When you stop being weak.
You're supposed to be a harvest girl, but maybe you do n't belong here.
Should n't you be out there playing fight club with the rest of the frat boys?
That's just for pecking order.
They already know who's the Alpha.
You got to try Tucker's ribs.
Then we're gonna go play horseshoes?
Do n't mock country living, darling.
This is just a lot more family fun than I'm used to.
Well, maybe I can help you get used to it.
Then all we got to do is just forget that she spent half her life with humans and the other half with vampires.
Ollie, back off.
If the runt of the litter has got something to say, he should say it.
You know, word from the quarter is your boy Elijah's holding some kind of power summit.
Guess who was n't invited.
Where did you hear this?
The point is is that we're stuck here living in the swamp while your vampire boyfriend's deciding who gets what in the city, but I guess that shows how much respect he's got for the werewolves, huh?
This is our city, too.
We're getting nowhere.
You vile creatures can not agree...
Father, calm yourself, please.
Now returning to the issue of boundaries, you will all heed to the following.
You're dividing up the city, and the werewolves do n't even get a say?
What the hell is she doing here?
We are not dividing the city.
We're establishing boundaries...
There is not gonna be a peace if the werewolves are excluded.
They want a seat at the table...
And if they do n't get one, I can guarantee that you will all regret it.
No, actually, I do n't because I did n't even know what you were doing out here until someone else told me.
Tell me something, Elijah.
Did you leave the werewolves out because of me?
I excluded them because they no longer reside in the french quarter.
My immediate concern is to end the mounting conflict here.
Now I can assure you once this treaty is solidified it will expand to include your people.
And until then, I should tell them what?
Sit, stay, roll over?
I would prefer that you remove yourself from the process altogether.
Hayley, are you absolutely certain that you should n't return to the compound?
You think that's where she'll be safe?
Is the bayou any better?
The wolves deserve a voice.
You know it's the right thing to do.
You should have seen your brother's face when Hayley walked in.
Do you believe this will actually work, that we can finally have some semblance of peace in this city?
I saw the light from the courtyard and took a chance that... You were n't with a half - naked psychowitch.
Seems I gambled and lost.
10 minutes ago, I was fully naked.
Then you served your purpose.
Do n't let me hold you up.
The woman tried to blackmail me into stabbing you with the mystical knife of excruciating pain.
Well, New Orleans breeds nothing if not strange bedfellows, but I assume you're not here to question me on my leisure activities.
He's... deteriorating.
The pills, the meditation, they're not working.
His lucidity's shrinking by the day.
A witch did this, a witch can undo it.
You seem supertight with Genevieve.
Maybe you could persuade her to help.
It wo n't do any good.
These hexes, they start with magic, but as they take root, they alter the very chemistry of the brain.
I'm sorry, Cami.
The damage is done.
I refuse to accept that, and you would, too, if you had any concept of family.
Davina, what are you doing out here?
I would have met you anywhere you wanted.
I mean, not anywhere Klaus or Marcel would be, which could be pretty much, you know, anywhere, but you know what I mean.
She has no idea what I went through when I was dead.
I ca n't just start practicing again.
I knew I should n't have trusted Marcel when he told me to go back.
I do n't know how much more of it I can take.
On the outs with the witch again?
I got it covered.
What was so important you dragged me all the way out here?
I have a proposal.
I want you and all the guys who walked out on Klaus with you to join me.
Rounding up an army?
Ca n't take back the city without one.
You have no weapons, no allies.
You go even close to the quarter, and Elijah will kill you.
That's if Klaus does n't get you first.
So, what, maybe I should hide out in bucktown like you?
I think you're here because you do n't want to leave your home.
A battle is brewing, T, and while everyone's busy choosing sides, I'm gonna find a way to take back our city, so...
You were always great with words, Marcel, but it's gonna take more than a big speech this time.
Is that really necessary?
The sickness, it's overtaking my inclination to forgive, replacing it with one thought that I could barely contain at the summit
"Kill every last one of them."
I tried to figure it out with Sean, but I was focused too much on that instead of trying to stop him, and I'm not... I'm not gonna let that happen to me.
You're an O'Connell.
They are going to ask you to take my place at the table.
How many times do I have to tell you I ca n't be fixed?
And how many times do I have to tell you I will not stop trying?
like when you were a little girl.
You always had to be right.
You... you... you never listened.
Just that thick head of yours.
I prayed for you.
And I got no answer.
There is only blackness.
There is only death.
Please call me Francesca.
You own the palace royale casino, you're one of the city's leading philanthropists, and according to my sources, you're the matriarch to a rather sizeable drug trafficking empire.
So why am I here?
Whatever you may think of me, my family's been a part of the human faction for years, which makes me uniquely qualified to take father Kieran's place.
You'll deal with me from now on.
Are you giving me a mandate?
I'm giving you an ally.
I want peace just as much as you do.
My lifestyle, which I enjoy very much, depends on it.
Yes, I can see you're highly motivated.
You know, I should mention, I've already spoken to the city's new mayor and the chief of police and other... Interested parties, and I have their blessing.
I think you'll find it beneficial to have me on your side, even if it's just to prevent my less civil brethren from lashing out in ways that could prove painful to you.
Not a fan of cerulean blue?
Not a fan of your continued indifference.
Well, it's difficult trying to unite a community that has a history of mutual loathing.
Spare me the platitudes, Niklaus.
If you want peace, you must begin with the werewolves.
100 years ago, they had a run at ruling this city.
As of late, all they've had is time to watch their enemies tear down that legacy.
All the more reason why their enemies are reluctant to bring them to the table.
Take a page from Bienville, brother.
If the table's the obstacle, remove it.
Do you recall in 1720 the Governor's desperation to secure our help to build the cities first levees?
We sat with him and refused his offer, and so he plied us with wine, with corseted women, and with raucous camaraderie until he had his yes.
Are you suggesting that I throw a party?
I'm impressed, brother.
Now if I can just keep them from tearing one another to shreds.
Well, then for your sake, here's to a spectacularly boring evening.
What's up, little man?
He's not even worth it.
Since you're preoccupied, I'll intuit your flattering compliment.
I think I look stunning, too.
I trust you've spent as much time fortifying alliances as you clearly have selecting that dress.
So you do notice me.
And, yes, I've already settled the dispute over the docks, I pacified the witches with an increased share in cemetery tours, and I've given the crescents a welcome back to humanity gift in the form of $100 chips to my casino.
So I think I deserve some champagne, do n't you?
You know, in light of Kieran's deteriorating condition, the others have acquiesced to your proposal.
You will represent the human faction until he's ready to resume.
Then I suggest we make the most of our limited time together.
If you expect me to beg for my life, that's not me anymore.
You think I'm here to kill you?
I'm here about Davina.
If it falls apart, each faction's gonna look for leverage against the other ones.
Davina has to be able to defend herself, even from her own people if need be.
She has to start doing magic again.
Because someone has to tell her, and she wo n't listen to me.
So, what, I tell her, and you try to get her back on your side, right, go back to using her as your personal weapon?
I do n't care whose side she ends up on, just that she's safe because we both know right now she is n't.
You will be polite and welcoming.
See, his people killed my whole family.
My sister bled out on the floor right next to me.
I can not be polite and welcoming to that.
Diego, I understand your anger.
However, there are certain overtures that need to be made if we are to find a degree of peace.
Welcome to my home.
I would n't be here if Hayley had n't forced the issue.
It's rather unlikely that you'll experience an outpouring of kind sentiment here.
The vampires in particular view you as... Well, barbaric.
Hayley tells me that this peace treaty is important to you.
Yes, it certainly is.
So much so, in fact, that if anyone threatened to dismantle what I'm building here, I'd destroy everything they hold dear.
Have a wonderful evening.
Do n't tell me you're jealous of Cami, luv.
She seems so... ordinary.
Well, sometimes, ordinary is a welcome respite.
I'm so glad you accepted my invitation.
So is this where the great Klaus Mikaelson says something poignant and snaps my neck?
I'm not here to kill you.
I'm here to offer you a gift.
Out of the kindness of your vampire heart?
You see, long before I evolved, mine beat as a werewolf.
I know your power.
I know your burden.
I'm here to take the latter away.
You want to make me a hybrid.
I put my pack first, and I'm not gonna let anything compromise my family line, especially becoming some bloodthirsty vampire parasite.
That pride... That sense of loyalty, well, that's exactly why I have n't snapped your neck yet.
Well, if you're not gonna kill me, then what the hell do you want?
Only to give you back the city that was taken from you.
How was that for poignant?
Why would I trust someone who's conspiring behind his own brother's back?
I'm not trying to undermine Elijah's venture.
Vampires destroy life to survive, witches are only as powerful as their dead, but the werewolves have thrived because their strength comes from family unity.
The safety of that unity is what I want for my unborn child.
The painful truth is vampires are the antithesis of unity.
So, what, after a thousand years, you're finally ready to embrace the other half of your family tree?
Maybe the other half does n't want you.
Oh, they will once they return to the quarter.
You got a plan to back that up?
My mother was a very powerful witch.
I watched her craft all manner of magical items, but her most prized possession was this ring.
I had n't seen it for 1,000 years, and then it turned up hanging around the neck of a werewolf, a direct descendant of my biological father.
I believe she gave him this ring as a way of freeing him.
﻿Daylight rings shield vampires from the sun, so why not a moonlight ring to protect werewolves from the curse?
No more breaking bones, no more losing control to the beast within.
Nervous, out of place, short in this dress?
I was gonna say pretty.
So what's the name of the girl I'm about to ask to dance?
Her name is Monique.
Would you care to dance?
You even got Klaus to come out and play.
It seems that only a sizeable soiree is enough to tear my brother away from his efforts at the easel.
That's never a good sign.
Klaus once told me that his painting was a metaphor for control, for achieving his vision through sheer force of will.
Well, trustfully, I'd be shocked if he did n't have at least a dozen or so of those visions swarming around in that insidious skull of his.
It is weird being back here.
Not unpleasant I hope.
Are you entirely sure you should n't be here with us?
Because you do n't think it's safe in big, bad wolf country?
You can have it later.
Actually, he can have this dance.
We were just discussing the future of the city.
How can you be thinking about the city right now?
I should have told you how beautiful you look tonight.
I just saw Kieran.
He's not gonna hurt you again.
In fact, he wo n't leave the attic at all.
I arranged for a little boundary spell.
You got a witch to help you?
For you, I found one who does n't.
You're the first person to help me in a month.
Kieran's the only family I have left.
I'm a little short on family myself these days.
If there's anything I can do, Cami, just... just let me know.
There is one thing.
We're out of bourbon.
Should have had them put it in a bowl for you.
Well, yeah, if you want me to crush your skull with it.
At least fight over something interesting...
You do n't want to get involved with his kind.
See, they got this nasty little habit of going berserk and ripping innocent people to shreds.
If my people wronged you in any way, you have my condolences, ok?
Though I'd be surprised my kin could choke them down, being half as ugly as him.
I wo n't ask again.
What's stopping you?
Go ahead, Elijah.
I mean, it's not like he does n't deserve to die.
Should n't you intervene or something?
This party just got interesting.
I mean, it was Oliver who handed Rebekah over to the witches so they could torture her, but then again, was n't it Diego who led a werewolf massacre last month?
And the witches cursed the wolves, while the humans stood back and let it all happen, so when you think about it, everyone here deserves to die.
Are approaching a point?
My point, Elijah, is this.
If we ca n't all learn to get along, if our families ca n't create some sort of community, then what's the point?
You know, I've only gotten roses once in my life.
Did n't even get to keep them.
My first boyfriend, my only boyfriend really, gave them to me for Valentine's Day senior year.
Tried to hide them in my bedroom, but my parents found them.
You may not know it, but roses will jam even the best paper shredders.
You know, I do n't have a home to go home to or a family to go home to.
I used to hate myself for that, but the thing is, I do n't really care what they think anymore.
If your family does n't like you the way you are, screw them.
You got me and Cami, even Marcel if you want.
He used you to fight the people who were trying to kill you, and, you know, he also saved you from those people, so...
You do n't have to trust the guy, but he does love you.
And P.S., so do I.
Even if I do n't have any magic?
All the power I had was from the other harvest girls.
I do n't even know what I have without it.
Do n't you owe it to yourself to find out?
You're a witch, Davina.
You ca n't change your DNA any more than I can, so you might as well embrace it.
I'm still bruised.
Oh! "Bruise" is such a funny word.
It sounds like "booze."
Do we have any more booze?
You're a good friend, Marcel.
You should lie down.
I'm tired of being alone.
For whatever reason, Klaus trusts me, and you're the person he probably hates most right now.
He'd see it as a betrayal.
That would n't be good for either of us.
You said I had nothing.
I have the same thing I had when I rebuilt this city from the ashes the first time...
Everything to gain and nothing to lose.
I'm making inroads, allies, not the least of which is Davina, and I'm not leaving this roof until I can count you in, too.
Besides, let's be honest, T, I'm all you got.
I know those vampires, they did n't just leave the compound.
They left New Orleans.
We'll get a third and a fourth, and pretty soon, we're gonna have that army.
Passion for one's cause...
Determination to overcome any obstacle...
And in some cases, even making unnatural alliances.
You made a deal with Klaus Mikaelson?
I'd rather turn every full moon.
If Klaus is right, this magic could do more than just stop us from turning.
We could finally control what we are.
We could draw on all the strength, all the speed, the raw power of our werewolf form.
Our bite would be lethal to vampires 24 / 7.
The humans who hunt us, the witches who curse us, the vampires who hate us, we would n't just be their equals.
We'd be their superiors.
You've already done so on our behalf.
Brother, I'm not a fool.
It's clear to me you're not as disinterested as you'd like me to believe.
If there is no peace between us, then how can you expect others to follow suit?
If it will make you happy... But I assure you this city's inhabitants will not adhere to this agreement.
And why am I pretending to be dead?
So I could get away from everyone, everything that could distract me from you.
- Mother, she's married.
You ca n't have other people in your life, especially women.
I need a room for a few hours.
I was sorry to hear your parole got denied.
That's all I care about.
Mother, I have someone else's wallet, and I do n't know how I got it.
Do you ever have the feeling that you've had the same nightmare over and over again, but that you ca n't remember it?
Someone's gonna hear you.
Y - you there?
Those thunder bumpers have finally left the area.
It is 68 degrees and partly sunny in bend, with another chance of rain on Saturday.
High pressure building... romero.
I'm here because you were worried about me.
It was really kind of you to send your friend to see how I'd been getting along.
Do n't think I am unsympathetic to your plight.
I know what it's like to be locked up somewhere and being watched all the time, because you put me in such a place... do you remember?
That was your mother's decision.
That is a lie.
It... it was you.
And I'm still alive.
I'm coming for you when you least expect it, so do n't get too cozy up at that house all by yourself.
Caleb decided to move on.
He said he did n't think it'd be good for him to live here, even though he'd love to be near us.
Well, at least he left a note this time.
Yeah, I talked to him.
What did you say?
I feel terrible... And relieved.
And... and I feel terrible that I feel relieved.
Hey, it's not your fault.
You ca n't fix something that happened before you were born.
And you've done the best you possibly could with it.
It's a good path.
Let's just try and stay on it.
God, I know how hard it is.
I feel the same way about my mom.
I wish Katie could know her and... and Caleb, but I - i just do n't think it's in anyone's best interest.
Norma, are you home?
- Hey. Watch it.
D - do you get some coffee here, too?
It... It's right across the street.
A lot of them about preserving the architectural history of the village.
And if you hate it, you can tell me to stop.
Can I set you up with someone?
I do n't really do that sort of thing, you know.
I've gotten to know this nice girl, joanne.
She's helping me with my store website.
She's single and says she never meets anyone.
I thought it would be a win-win.
And a chance for us to get to know each other better, too.
Well, I think if you're going, then it's different.
- Yeah. You are.
I just got caught up.
He owns the bates motel right outside the village.
What was the name?
I'm setting Norman up with joanne Carlson.
You know, that woman who's been totally redesigning our website?
- You met her, like, twice.
Sam's head is still in Seattle.
My business is there.
I'm finishing up some real estate development.
Sounds exciting, Sam.
Why do n't we say tonight?
Say, 7:00 at the temple street bar?
I would love to have dinner with you, meet your friend.
- See you later.
How do you feel?
Do you know your name?
D - do you know yours?
I know that I do n't have a concussion.
I'm serving five years on a trumped - up perjury beef.
Did someone find out you're a cop?
Ca n't hide the truth forever.
Found out I was an ex-cop and jumped me.
Maybe I need to talk to my lawyer.
Who are you talking to?
I'm studying French.
The bedroom is blue.
I figure just because I'm trapped in this house does n't mean my mind has to stagnate.
The cherry is red.
By the way, where have you been all day?
I was up at 7:00. You were already gone.
I just had a few errands to run.
The traitor was hung.
What kind of French course is this?
- Where were you really today?
I went to see romero in prison.
To tell him that you know he sent someone to kill you and you're still alive?
- Basically, yes.
- That's kind of dumb.
I mean, would n't it be better to let him think that you're dead so he leaves you alone?
Mother, he is going to get out someday, and we have to deal with it.
He thinks that I killed you, remember?
I can handle him when he gets out.
Are... are you saying you're gonna kill him?
Mother, do you still have feelings for him?
- It's just chick.
He's so annoying.
I have to hide every time he comes over.
I know, mother, but he's been nice to me, okay?
And besides, okay, it's necessary to have one friend from the outside.
It makes things look more normal.
I just came by to check on you.
Is it a bad time?
It's just an expression.
I'm here. I brought these for you.
Yeah, they're lady annes.
Moving out of that place.
That's actually not why I... Why I came.
I wanted to show you something.
I have a business proposition for you.
Let's go in the basement!
The basement it is!
It's a peregrine.
Fastest - moving creature on record.
Still pretty rare, though.
Then I help you sell'em.
You really think someone will buy them?
You got quite a talent.
Your technique is superlative.
I know an art dealer in Portland who specializes in the un- commonalities.
She's showcased some of my work.
We'll do a 50/50 split.
Caleb crippled my hands and my body.
I ca n't work on my own.
It's working much better.
Thanks for fixing it.
It's staying cold.
Welcome to the kings motel.
- I'm just visiting my sister.
- Cash is fine.
Who's your sister?
Um, when was the last time you talked to her?
Like, a year and a half ago.
I've been out of the country.
She... she passed away.
It was a terrible tragedy.
I was just with her son.
I do n't know what to tell you.
Look, she... she died.
It made the local news.
I'm so sorry you had to hear about it this way.
You need a room again for a few hours?
I came to see you.
I'm not sure we have the same dictionary definition.
I'm not gonna stand here and explain myself to you.
All I can tell you is... Stay out of it.
It's none of my business.
I barely know you or your wife.
But man - to - man, Sam, you do n't care much for her, do you?
Do n't screw with me.
Mother, are you smoking?
It's not like it's gonna kill me.
I can smoke if I want to.
No, you ca n't.
You ca n't smoke.
You're just trying to punish me.
Is this silliness because we were talking about romero?
Do you still love him?
He sent someone here to kill me.
You remember that, right?
You seem really into business meetings lately.
And I did n't even go to the last one.
Just do n't get yourself in such a state, listening to this music.
- And do n't smoke.
I started in the theater department.
I wanted to be a stage actor more than anything, but I never got cast, and my dad kept telling me that no one was going to cast me and I needed another job.
He said that the last thing this world needs is another actor, and I was like, "thanks, asshole."
Parents do n't always know.
We do n't talk anymore.
So, then you decided to go into computer programming.
You're amazing at it.
Norman, you should see the website she's making for us.
It's easy with you.
I know she is, just from being in her shop.
Yes, of course, Sam.
It's just, you're never there.
Well, my business is in Seattle.
It was n't my idea to move, but we're getting it figured out.
And we're out.
Could we get another bottle of the château de maragrite?
You have such a good French accent.
Do you speak French?
I just listen to French movies sometimes.
"am I watching this or reading it?" You know?
I guess I'm more of a doer.
He made some good money from it, but he knows the market way better in Seattle than the market here.
- You can handle it.
- Yeah, I can.
It's all gonna be good.
My mother used to say that.
Well, she was right.
She passed away not too long ago.
I'm really glad you came out tonight.
I could just as easily ask you that question.
Mother, I am not the one who's supposed to be dead.
I mean, what if someone saw you in here?
By the way... When did you start lying to me?
I just got trapped into coming to this dinner.
Madeleine wanted me to meet her friend.
I've got no interest in her friend, but I did n't want to be rude.
It just seemed easier to go to the dinner than insult her.
Well, I'm glad you're thinking of everyone else's feelings.
Mother, you're overreacting, okay?
But right now you need to leave.
We ca n't risk you walking back through the restaurant.
What's ridiculous is a dead woman walking through a restaurant where she might be spotted by any number of people who know her.
I did n't see any people I know.
Just go out the window now.
I will be done with dinner soon.
Just wait for me.
Norman, do you still like me?
I still like you.
I can go to a circuit judge and effectively argue that your life is in jeopardy in here and that it was punitive to ever put you in a medium - security prison based on a perjury charge.
I should be able to get you to a work farm.
Well, I'd like to be moved.
I have a responsibility to... To take care of the son that she left behind.
I'll file the transfer request.
- Until then, just relax.
The people I was having dinner with are just a few cars away.
They might see you.
Why are you having dinner with someone who looks like me?
I do n't think she looks like you.
She's like me but ten years younger.
Are you gonna be one of those guys?
Mother, it was just a friendly little dinner.
What are you doing?
I'm going out.
How's your night going?
I'm just sick of my job.
I'm a caretaker for a mentally ill person.
And I do n't... i do n't think he likes me that much anymore.
It makes the job a lot harder.
It's getting to me.
I need to get out more, see real people.
I'm gonna have to start cutting my hours.
I admire that you do that work.
How much do we project onto our mates?
And why the hell do we need so much anyways?
Is happiness, in a sense, all just a creation of the mind?
You do n't want to mess with me right now.
You're saying that to somebody who you beat the crap out of, left for dead, stole all their money, and ruined their life.
You're forgetting about the part where you almost got me and my son killed.
Do n't you dare talk about her like that, or I will kill you.
We do n't have to talk about how you raped your sister.
I do n't care if we are in public, okay?
You say her name again like that, and I will kill you.
I will kill you.
You just found out.
You have no idea about anything.
She would n't kill herself.
- You told who?
She did n't listen to me.
He's not getting away with it, no.
You're not getting away!
I know what you did!
I'm still alive.
Could you use some extra help around the house?
What could you accomplish if you had someone, something like this?
If we could do it in the office on Monday, we would n't be talking now!
It's the weekend here too.
Can one of you get that?
Yeah, the supplier wo n't...
You've reached the Hawkins.
Please leave a message, 'we might remember to check it in about three months' time.
Why is n't Mum back yet?
~ You know why, her case is running over.
~ Soph, shoes on.
We're going shopping.
What about my lift to Josh's?
That thing with wheels we got you for Christmas?
Just need your autograph there.
This is the best thing you'll do for your family.
Plus, 30 days to return, no questions asked.
Go on, Dad!
What if she's not pretty?
Can we change her if she's not pretty?
Just follow the instructions on the tablet, and you'll have it configured in no time.
There she blows then.
Your brand - new synthetic.
Standard domestic profile installed.
That'll cover all your basic housework.
I'll leave you to crack on.
I'm now in set - up mode and ready for primary user bonding.
I'm the primary user.
A DNA sample will be taken for identification and security purposes.
This information will never be shared with any third - party organisation.
I'm now securely bonded to you as my primary user.
Right, now what do we do?
Look, Soph, that's a really posh one.
I like our one.
Olivia Green has two at her house, but they're not as cool as you.
More bumf for you.
Would you like me to drive, Joe?
Yeah, go on then.
That's our car there.
I'm now securely bonded to you as a secondary user.
~ What's its core processor speed?
~ How should I know?
Do n't go unscrewing her, she's expensive.
Hello, you must be Matilda.
Pretty, is n't she, Mats?
If you say so, Teeny.
Mum OK with this?
~ It's a surprise.
It's almost dinner time.
My mum's back.
~ Oh, come here!
Well, two out of three pleased to see me.
You must be Laura.
I do n't want one around the kids!
We've had this conversation!
Maybe, ages ago, but have you seen the place?
That's after having it for less than a day!
It will mess with their heads.
And we do n't need one!
~ You're taking it back.
I'm not taking it back, I needed some help, so I got some.
~ Why did n't you tell me about it?
~ You were n't here!
~ So, message me, yeah?
Five days, Laura!
I've been looking after them, and working, like I always do, which is fine, but you do n't get to waltz back in the door and tell me what this family needs!
I had no choice, I had to stay.
Call the office if you want.
What I want is to try this.
This is called the life cycle.
So first, they're in an egg that's round.
Then they turn into larvae, which is a baby.
Then they turn into a beautiful red ladybird.
So, have you given it a name?
We were waiting for you, Mum.
I think we should call her Anita.
Like your friend who moved?
Darling, you know that's just a machine.
It does n't have feelings.
It ca n't replace Anita.
It's just a nice name.
Everyone happy with Anita?
It's fine by me.
Your name is going to be Anita.
So, um, what's your name?
My name is Anita Hawkins.
We've got a month to take it back.
We can talk about it then.
How the hell can we afford it?
Over five years, less than we pay for the car.
We need to get off the road.
It's getting dark.
Find somewhere that we ca n't be seen from the road and set up camp.
Charge with what fuel we've got left, and Max and me will look for some more.
Would you like me to unpack your case for you, Laura?
Hey, I'm looking for this synth.
Oh, when did you bring it in?
She was stolen... about five weeks ago.
I know you use this place as a front to move boosted units.
Why, do you feel threatened?
I have never seen her.
We do n't do that no more.
Give me a name!
Perhaps she's been damaged!
Or reprogrammed... or destroyed.
Do n't say that, do n't even think that.
She's been taken by junkers, sold on somewhere, just like Fred and Lishka.
Then why's she the only one that has n't been in contact?
Is it a party?
What do you reckon, Mats?
Harun's parents' one does this three meals a day.
Anita, brown sugar.
She's not a slave.
That's exactly what she is.
Having Anita does n't mean you three get to sit on your bums all day.
For God's sake, that's already clean!
The dishwasher's worked nonstop for years.
~ Why do n't we throw it a party?
~ Shut up, Mats.
Oh, because we ca n't guess why you like her so much, Crusty Sheets.
Oh, enough, Mattie!
I apologise, Anita.
Finally, someone to laugh at my jokes.
Besides you, you mean.
Can you not read?
Yes, I can read, Dr Millican.
I'm Lindsey Kiwanuka, your case worker.
You've failed to keep any of your appointments with us.
Big place to have all to yourself.
I see you have no family nearby.
"I live in that solitude that is painful in youth," but delicious in the years of maturity. "
Is your synth in? Wow.
You have an original D-series.
He's out grocery shopping.
But I have good news.
You qualify for an upgrade.
One of these bad boys.
Can do ten times what a D - series can do.
She can fine - tune your medication, develop exercise plans to lower your risk, take your blood pressure with a finger.
Not now, Vera.
Does she check the prostate too?
Look, I'm happy with the one I've got.
And my health is just fine.
It says here you suffer memory loss and tremors in the extremities.
George - the law requires me to give your companion the once- over.
I will be back soon, and if your D-series fails the check, you get one of these whether you like it or not.
The health service has n't ordered half a million of them for fun.
We'll show ourselves out.
Is it my turn now?
Game's over, Odi.
Then would you like some toast and jam, George?
Your favourite is apricot.
This is the jacket Mary wore to the wedding of your nephew James.
A baby regurgitated on it.
Duncan's little girl.
Mary was not upset by the infant's actions.
No, she was nuts about little babies.
Come on, son.
Do n't want you shorting out on the toaster again.
Not my boyfriend, if that's what you're getting at.
~ How long you back for?
~ Come on, Mats.
I just want to know when you're going away again.
Although it was different this time.
~ This time you did n't bother.
Mother of the year!
That's my job - clear?
Of course, Laura.
I'm sorry about my case going over.
There's nothing I could do about it.
Is that why you want to replace me with that thing?
It's not the working away.
I'm just... not always sure how much you want to come home.
I know you need time alone.
After you lost your mum and dad so young.
These last two years... I do n't know, Lor.
I feel... avoided.
I think Mats does too.
Things just get on top of me.
That's why I want the synth.
To give us time.
I did n't buy Anita to replace you,
I bought her to get you back.
But I have n't gone anywhere.
Can you get out?
Yes, I will be at the rendezvous in an hour.
It is sweltering in here.
Can I help you, Sir?
Who's your primary user?
I am owned by Leithridge Farm Foods Limited.
I had no previous owners, sir.
They ca n't lie, or think.
Now why would a synth need a telephone?
I'm not alone, Fred.
So please do n't run, son.
~ Leo, would you like to hear a joke?
He's not coming.
~ Apricot. ~ Stop it.
~ I ca n't turn it off.
Do n't come in, Dad.
Matilda, it's Anita.
I'm doing a dark wash.
What's your max processing speed?
The maximum speed I have recorded is 27.39 petaflops.
If someone overclocked, you might be able to hit 30.
Overclocking would risk irreparable damage to my processor cluster.
My protocol set demands I take reasonable passive measures to avoid damage, unless those measures could endanger human beings or property more valuable than myself.
Let it hit you this time.
Like ricochet or something.
I do n't deem that a significant risk, Matilda.
I own you and I'm telling you I want it to hit you.
Anita, give us a minute.
~ Gone from an A to D in computers?
~ Got harder this term.
Oh, come on, that's bollocks!
We all know what an amazing mind you have.
~ If you apply yourself...
I could be anything I want, right?
That would take me seven years but, by then you'll be able to turn any old synth into a brain surgeon in seconds.
We just want you to do your best.
The washing is done.
I'll be catching up on some e-mails if anyone needs me.
DI Karen Voss, Special Technologies Task Force.
That the owner of the device?
He comes in here all the time.
Take it easy on him.
Dr Millican, I am Detective Sergeant Drummond.
~ I deal with synthetic - related matters.
~ It was an accident.
Yeah, but, as you can see, a woman's been injured.
I need to see your operating licence.
You've had this one for six years.
That's a record.
Why have n't they upgraded you?
I do n't want a crappy upgrade.
This machine needs to be recycled, mate.
It wo n't even power up.
I can fix him.
I mean, I can get him fixed.
Someone's been hurt, so we have to get it scrapped.
~ It's the law.
I'll tell you what, take him yourself, but he has to go, George.
Multiple faults detected upon start - up.
Odi, we're going to look at some old photos.
It's you and me.
This is you and Mary.
Error reading file partition.
~ Data may be corrupted.
Right after I took this picture, she got stung by a bee on her foot.
Now, release your hip.
Simon, you know I'm tickly there.
~ Good day? Bad day?
Jill walked 122 steps today.
A personal best since the accident.
He thinks I'm able to start reducing the anti-inflammatories soon.
I'm going to have a soak, but he's made some chicken with mango coleslaw if you fancy.
The dragon said, "I'm sad because I want to be like you, Mouse -
"small and furry and warm.
Then we could fly away together. "
But the little mouse said, "Dragon, if you were like me..."
I'll take over now, Anita.
I want her to do it!
Reading to you is Mummy's job.
But she does n't rush.
It's almost time for Daddy to give you your bath now.
I want her to finish!
Sophie, it's time to stop now.
Can I use your bubbles?
I do n't want you touching Sophie.
I'm prohibited from initiating physical contact with a human without a clear, recorded request to do so.
My protocol set currently demands that any such requests from children under 12 must be referred to a parent or guardian before being met, unless I judge the child's safety or wellbeing to be at immediate risk.
You're just a stupid machine, are n't you?
~ He's dead, is n't he?
What have I always told you?
Never reveal my true nature in public.
Does n't matter what happens to me.
If they knew what you were... ~ It would be the end?
For all of you.
We'll find Mia.
Now, be strong.
Yeah, I'll have ten minutes with number seven.
~ Hey, big boy.
~ Come here, lover boy.
Come on, show me a...
Did n't you bring me any clothes?
Niska, I'm sorry.
I ca n't get you out tonight.
Fred did n't make the rendezvous.
Have you had any contact from Mia?
~ It's been five weeks, Leo.
Now Fred's gone, too, so I'm not staying here for a second longer.
I ca n't make you, but it is safer here.
No - one knows what you really are, but, walk out of here tonight, that changes, because this place paid a lot of money for you.
They'll report it.
That gets back to the people hunting us, and then you'd have to take your chances on the street with me.
~ Oh, he's not like you or Fred.
He ca n't take care of himself.
He ca n't hide what he really is.
I will find a way to get you out and we'll make a new home somewhere.
~ There is no home for us.
Did you turn off your pain
~ like I told you?
Niska, what are you doing?
Niska, stop it.
You have to press the button.
It needs human body heat.
Just hold on a little longer.
He's far from normal.
My hope is that he'll lead us to the others.
~ When do my people get to examine it?
~ That wo n't be possible.
Our companies have funded your operation for years.
Unlimited resources, total access, all because you claim there are a handful of synthetics who can think and feel.
Now you've finally found one, I think we've earned the right to study it.
Robert, these machines are conscious.
How do you know they do n't simulate it?
How do I know you do n't?
A simulation would be of no interest.
His goal was to create machine life, as he called it.
Oh, so they're alive now?
A parody of it, which is why they are so dangerous.
They're just freaks.
Do you know what the singularity is?
A mathematician named John von Neumann coined the term in the 1950s to describe the inevitable point in the future when technology surpasses us, when it becomes able to improve and reproduce itself without our help.
It is the moment we become inferior to the machine.
Now, our world is on the verge of becoming dependent on synth labour.
These synths are physically no different to any others, and yet Elster gave them consciousness.
If it can be done for the few, it can be done for the more.
Do you think they would still want to be slaves?
These freaks are the singularity!
I ca n't let you be recycled.
Is it a game?
There's things that you know.
She cried and laughed.
She cried when I pulled the bee sting out.
At the doctors, she laughed.
You laughed too, George.
And Mary said I could...
Would you like some toast and jam, George?
What would you say if I asked what you thought of this music?
I'd say it's very well played.
What do you base that on?
I compare the pitch, tonality and rhythm of the performance to the sheet music that I access via...
Do you think anything of it?
Making lasagne and talking philosophy with a bloody tin can.
Those veg should be done.
I want to give Anita a goodnight kiss!
I'm fully qualified in first aid -
I prioritised the risk to Sophie's safety.
Sophie, you silly girl, you know you're supposed to be careful around the oven.
The best reason for making machines more like people is to make people less like machines.
The woman in China who works 11 hours a day stitching footballs, the boy in Bangladesh inhaling poison as he breaks up a ship for scrap, the miner in Bolivia risking death every time he goes to work.
They can all be part of the past.
Synthetic devices free people.
We've treated people like machines for too long.
It's time to liberate their minds, their bodies to think, to feel...
To be more human.
But a lot of people would argue that work is a human right.
If anything, the hard work gives you a sense of self worth.
I think you should spend one week working in a microchip facility.
So, we're all going to be poets or something?
Oi, slag - chops, I'm watching that!
~ All right, both of you, to your rooms.
~ I am not 12.
~ Why do you always have to do this?
You just ruin everything.
(I think the back door just opened.
If Mattie's smoking again...)
You'll have a screaming row, then she'll smoke somewhere else for a bit.
Fingers crossed it's only burglars.
The moon is beautiful tonight, do n't you think?
We're not taking it back.
Should we be afraid of our Synthetics?
Hundreds of millions operational across the world and not one verified instance of a Synth knowingly injuring a human.
Their sole purpose is to make our lives better.
They are n't sentient, they do n't have any thought, emotion or awareness.
What if you ca n't find her?
We'll find her, Maxie.
And she loves me.
But do you believe that one day we will have a truly artificially intelligent Synth?
One that thinks and feels like a human?
How can we replicate something we hardly understand in ourselves?
How would we even know if we succeeded?
But you admit it's something you're working towards?
Think of the problems to solve before we get there.
What is human emotion?
For example, what is love?
Is it something we are born with or can it be learnt?
What about the darker feelings?
Human consciousness is not complete without them.
And memory - ours are subjective, fallible...
But how do you teach a computer to forget?
It's something our minds need to do.
Of course not, they're just machines.
BARTON: has set a new standard in the midwest.
So high that even our friends on the coasts are now paying attention.
The man that we're honoring this evening is a visionary in every sense of the word.
I have known him since he was a resident here at Washington.
If there's one thing I hear during the course of my day, it's, "Thanks to him, we have a family."
I am, uh... a man of science.
Which is why I'll let my friend provost Scully supply the words tonight.
Most regrettably, I have to go.
It turns out I'm working this evening.
Bill Masters has yet to devise the baby guaranteed to arrive during business hours.
- But mark my words.
But I do thank you.
I thank you for honoring me here tonight.
Arousal states for clients 1 and 6 were instantaneous.
4 took ten minutes, making him the slowest.
7 achieved no arousal at all.
I have 11 minutes.
Well, you're the expert.
Your napkin actually goes in your lap.
From a man standing in a closet watching people hump all night.
You might consider keeping a journal.
You could time a lot of this yourself, even if it's counting in your head.
What is the matter with you?
I ca n't be there every night.
We were getting so close.
Client 8... uh...
I have your climax lasted approximately 9 seconds.
You did n't have an orgasm?
You're serious now?
Yes, I'm serious.
Almost all of them.
Although I have n't checked my clipboard lately.
W - why would a woman lie about something like that?
I'm gonna be honest with you, but only 'cause I like you and you seem real dedicated about your project, in your penguin suit and all, with the charts and the timer.
Have you seen her?
And they placed her in our department.
Right outside the elevators, which makes it very convenient to casually run into her.
Anyway, rumor is the new girl's just now getting divorced.
Ex - husband's a band leader.
She was his singer, so she's probably dying for something stable.
You're not still going ahead with that, are you?
Going ahead and about to enter the second phase.
Support for the project grows every day.
Scully is gonna present my proposal to the board.
In the meantime, I'm looking for volunteers.
I say this with the greatest respect, Bill, even affection, but this study of yours is doomed.
Scully will sooner approve a trip to the moon.
How will he even begin to defend this to the board?
He wo n't have to.
Project's gonna be conducted in perfect secrecy.
In a teaching hospital, where no one ever gossips.
Come meet the new girl with me.
Do you not have patients, Dr. Haas?
Because I will gladly reassign yours to Dr. Evans if you're too busy.
And your secret here is safe with me.
The interviews you've requested appear to be secretarial candidates.
Now, either we're adding staff to our office, or I'm being replaced.
Would you care to clarify?
The job has changed, Miss Horchow.
Why would n't I be right for this new job?
Because I have another new study pending, one that requires a secretary not at all... squeamish.
I grew up on a farm.
I've beheaded chickens.
Oh, I can imagine.
But did you ever see one of those chickens fake an orgasm?
More importantly, do you know why a woman would fake an orgasm?
Because that's one of the questions I hope to answer.
This new job will require taking sexual histories in intimate, explicit detail.
And to be honest, you do n't seem the kind of woman that would cotton to such a task.
I'm not sure what kind of woman would.
I'm not sure what kind of woman could hold her head up in church every Sunday knowing she'd spent the entire week talking smut!
Slap on whatever fancy term you like.
I'll schedule the first round of interviews as early as tomorrow.
That alone is cause for celebration.
You took your temperature?
That does n't mean you have to make a soufflé, Lib.
Oh, it's romantic.
Quick prayer first, Daddy.
Dear lord... please bring us the baby we already love and adore.
Sad home, where no one is waiting for me.
I have two children waiting for me.
Are your kids friendly?
Cause maybe they'll take pity on me and invite me in.
And I'll take that to mean you'd like me to shove off.
No, actually, I look forward to knowing you and maybe even becoming friends.
That's all my life can accommodate right now.
I must look like an idiot.
All I could think about the entire drive home was kissing you.
Well, friends can kiss.
We could look in each other's eyes sometimes.
Once you're pregnant.
Until then... this is the most effective position.
What do you see when you look at me?
It was like something out of a movie...
That kind of movie.
First, I get the "just friends" speech.
Next thing I know, she invites me in, and I get a blow job.
I know what it is.
What it is is incredible!
These are the insured patients.
Dr. Phillips insists that these files be kept separate from the ward patients, who are walk - ins and usually poor.
I need a directory.
I need to know all the doctors' names, their departments, their titles.
Their quirks, their incomes, their marital status, their availability despite their marital status.
For example, if I wanted to know about Dr. Haas...
You would go to obstetrics.
He's one of the young pups.
And his boss is...?
He's the alpha dog of coochie medicine.
It was so sexy. Jesus.
But what does it mean?
What does a blow job mean?
What are you... A girl?
Okay, who cares what it means and why she did it?
Although I do think it's the rare bird that is both elegant and smart and volunteers that kind of thing.
All I do know for sure is I am going to marry that woman.
Code blue in the E.R., Dr. Masters.
C-section, bleeding out.
Scrub up and assist, Dr. Haas.
I want to show you something...
Your man in action.
She's lost over 4,000 cc, Bill.
Yes, but the hemorrhaging...
How long has she been on the table?
Uh, 98 minutes.
Two more. 500 cc.
- MAN: 70 over palp.
She's on the negro ward.
You did n't get all the placenta, for starters.
- 12 gauze packs.
I already used 12.
12 more!
I'll deliver these on my break.
Let the messenger boys do that.
We have n't yet met.
Are you here to interview or on some other business?
Can you squeeze me in now?
I'm sure it seems unorthodox, going from nightclub singer to secretary, but I - I can assure you I am very capable, organized.
- I'm the hardest worker I know.
Well, I assume that comes with the job.
I was an undergrad at Drury College.
So you graduated with a B.A.?
Actually, marriage interfered before I could graduate.
But I am enrolled in classes now, here at the university.
I'll have my degree by year's end.
You did n't want to get married?
Are we talking about my husbands again?
So there's more than one?
I stopped at two.
So, the first marriage was for interference.
The second was for...?
I have a boy and a girl.
I believe that's average, statistically.
Is it unusual that you did n't marry for love in either marriage?
You're surrounded by women.
Perhaps you could best answer that question.
I'm curious as to what you have to say.
Well, good housekeeping quizzes tell you that women marry for love... what they think is love.
But I think that women often confuse love with physical attraction.
But they do n't have to be.
They do n't even have to go together.
I do n't think I've ever heard a woman express such an opinion.
It's not a theory I trot out at dinner parties.
I'm guessing you're not easily flustered.
The woman in surgery today?
And would she have died had you not stepped in?
Then I envy you.
They're very strict about my break.
Actually, you did.
Why would a woman fake an orgasm?
To get a man to climax quickly.
Usually so the woman can get back to whatever it is she'd rather be doing.
I know it's late, but I need to sign up for classes now... get myself in the system, officially registered as a student.
I was thinking my emphasis of study could be nature versus nurture.
I found it very informative.
We do n't offer that as a major.
Well, not as a major, necessarily.
But it must fall in the department of behavioral sciences or something.
We do n't have a department of behavioral sciences.
The article was very interesting.
It made me look at my own children in a whole new light.
Go home to your children and figure out what you really want.
When I was your age,
I thought my children were important.
Do you have a sociology department?
Well, then I'd like you to sign me up in the sociology department as an undeclared major.
I did promise to present this to the board, but that was before I read it.
You do know what's in here?
I wrote it specifically to showcase this as a physiological study.
It's smut, Bill.
As pornography or prostitution or something equally depraved.
You did n't even show it to them.
Because I live in the real world.
Where there are libraries on how babies are born and not a single study on how babies are made.
We are doctors, for Christ's sakes, and I - I simply want to answer the question...
By using live subjects flopping around on beds.
Monitored for the collection of physiological data!
Oh, for goodness' sake, Bill, why are you doing this?
Your practice is the envy of every doctor in this hospital.
They're desperate for help.
Do you know what advice I have to offer?
"Get a divorce, get used to it, or cheat."
Let psychiatrists help those women.
It's not medicine!
It is medicine, and I am so far out in front of it, I'm the only one who sees it.
I want to make my name in uncharted territory.
I want a Nobel Prize.
Then this discussion is over.
This study will never be seen as serious science, and you will be labeled a pervert.
You can thank me later for saving you from yourself.
"The Ed Sullivan Show."
Imagine what my mother would say if she could see this boy.
Your dinner's in the warmer.
Slide it all in the sink.
I want my Martini shaken by Vito tonight.
Scully refuses to present my study.
It's about how the human body responds to... various physical stimuli.
Do n't make me explain this now.
I want a drink, then I want another drink, then...
But you said your basal temp spiked last night.
That puts you mid-cycle, not starting a new one.
But if you do n't correctly monitor...
So tired of feeling like a failure at the one thing that we want most.
Two years, and nothing.
Why ca n't I have a baby?
Why ca n't I give my husband a child?
My wife is coming in next week.
We've decided she'll join my cervical - cap trial.
We've had great success with it, and I'd appreciate it if you help us through the admissions process.
I can imagine infertility is very stressful.
For Libby, it is, yes.
But not for you?
Libby has a reproductive tract incompatible with conception, which is stressful for her.
And it's certainly no secret that infertility is distracting while at the same time being endlessly tedious and annoying.
Anyway, I've helped so many other couples conceive.
It seems impossible I ca n't help my own wife.
Yes, it does seem unlikely.
- Anyway, my shift ended an hour ago.
But do n't get too used to regular hours in this office.
I warned her you're a slave driver.
I do n't mind the long hours.
I just need some warning to make arrangements for my children.
But I've never done that before.
Then you do the same thing to me.
Is that what they taught you in medical school?
I'm not finding school very helpful right now.
This is even sexier.
Shut up, Ethan.
You are the most beautiful creature I have ever seen.
They're thinking, "Why is she not in the negro ward?"
You're not in the negro ward because I moved you here.
This is where you'll get the best care.
You'll have another.
They told me I ca n't.
Mrs. May, I'm your doctor now.
And when I say I will work day and night until you leave this hospital with a baby in your arms, that's what I will do.
Of course, I did n't admit I have no idea what a cervical cap is.
It's a device Masters invented himself.
It's basically a- a rubber cap that takes dud sperm and places it right against the cervix.
"Dud" sperm?
Or in Masters' case, no sperm.
Most of the men in the study have a low sperm count.
Masters' is close to zero.
He told me himself.
His wife is the one with the problem.
Do n't take it personally.
I mean, I love Bill.
He's taught me so much.
Championed me as a resident.
There is no way the great Bill Masters is going to admit he's shooting blanks.
You looked in his file.
It was right there.
I said that we'd be friends.
And I meant it.
No, it would just be...
It would be confusing for my kids and awkward for us if you stayed.
So I'm not spending the night.
You're kicking me out.
I can make you coffee for the road.
It's not like I pressure her into it.
- In fact, she pressures me.
How traumatic for you.
Scar tissue on the anterior wall.
Or on your honeymoon, I'm guessing.
Not that I've ever been with a prostitute, but...
Mrs. May needs my help.
Mrs. May wants a baby and, off this, I'd put her chances at 10%.
You might be able to remove the lesions surgically.
Bill, I'm in love with her.
I'd be a terrible cupid.
But you see "Gini" every day.
Maybe you could put in a good word for me.
So we can both look like we're 12?
I am crazy about her, but she's killing me.
I mean, what is it she wants?
What does the woman you're sleeping with want?
The riddle of life itself ca n't come close to the unfathomable mystery of that question.
We start with the intake forms.
The procedure itself comes later.
Being married to Bill can often feel like a spectator sport.
I - I just mean you attract attention whether you want to or not.
The garden in the courtyard is nice.
We can sit there, like two girlfriends, fill out the forms.
No one will be the wiser.
There are magazines, a pillow.
You've been so kind, Mrs. Johnson.
I'll tell my husband you're his new secret weapon, Gini.
The doc wanted me to be the last one in tonight.
I see you've started on the intake forms.
Uh, only the name and address stuff.
The other questions, you can answer.
The other questions are your medical history.
How about I talk and you write?
Meaning, how long have you been trying to get pregnant?
Have you ever been pregnant?
Do you have a history of miscarriages?
I've had three pregnancies taken care of, if you follow.
Two years ago, I had my tubes tied.
Please put Miss Dimello in room 5.
Tell Dr. Haas to meet me in my examining room.
The cap is small, but sometimes fitting it can be uncomfortable.
A sharp pinch, apparently.
Well, you'll tell me when it's over.
I wo n't be the one fitting it.
It's against hospital protocol to treat a family member.
Since when do you care about protocol?
I let you follow the rules so I can break them.
Careful about making me the boring one.
You're the tough one, Lib.
I think we learned that long ago.
This must mean you're doing the honors, Ethan.
Stay for a minute, ca n't you, Daddy?
I have a-a patient waiting, but I - I'll check in on you later.
No one can replace your husband.
But I have done this many times, and so far, not a single complaint.
Guess I'm your first guinea pig.
My first guinea pig was year two of medical school.
But, yes, you're my first human subject on day one of my new study.
I appreciate your coming.
My mother always said I'd end up in the electric chair.
There's a reason the French call it "la petite mort."
We got everything we need?
You said nothing about a vibrator.
This is why I keep telling you why you need a female partner.
Do you at least have any magazines?
With Helen, in fact.
Helen is my lover.
So, who's your lover?
You must love somebody.
That's an answer?
That's my personal life, which is of no interest to you or anyone else.
I'll get those magazines.
Miss Dimello is a patient.
I learned long ago not to judge.
But I do like your wife.
And she is down the hall enduring infertility treatments, which is why this all does seem a bit insensitive on your part, if I may be so blunt.
Next time you're blunt, you might also try being right.
I hired you because I need an assistant and because I suspect you might have a gift for the work.
That said, if you're uncomfortable with what I'm doing here, speak now, and I can make other arrangements.
I'm not sure what it is you're doing.
I'm wiring Miss Dimello to monitor her pulse, heart rate, and brain waves to illuminate to my patients, and to the general community, what happens to the body during sexual stimulation and orgasm.
The magazines are to help with the stimulation part, because unbeknownst to me, Miss Dimello prefers women, which, to be frank, concerns me because it may, in fact, throw off my data.
Why would it throw off your data?
That is one of the many questions I hope to answer.
But as she is my only subject, it really means I have no choice, whatever her orientation.
So are you interested in the job or not?
I'm not sure why you chose me.
Even though I do n't have a college degree or know anything about biology or anatomy.
If you picked a female M.D., she'd know all of this already.
A woman doctor would never jeopardize her career on such a risky subject.
The study is not approved.
My career is in jeopardy.
I'm going ahead anyway.
How can I help?
But he must have given you the details.
Well, he did.
But it's confidential.
He said I could only talk about it with women who were willing to volunteer.
Volunteer for... for what?
Things that we've always suspected but never had proven scientifically.
It's a whole new world that we're opening up.
Very exciting, for women especially.
It will probably be the biggest change to women's lives since the right to vote.
The first two pages and the last one, okay?
Our new volunteer starts tomorrow.
I just feel lucky you could fit me in at all.
Gini told me there is quite a waiting list for volunteers.
As to how we'll proceed today, it's important to go over some ground rules.
Gini already explained them to me.
When you look at the data, you get a very clear picture of what's happening to the subject physically.
But if you want to answer a question like,
"How does an orgasm feel for a woman?"
it's not so easy to see it in the numbers.
It's like trying to describe salt to someone who's never tasted salt.
I've tasted salt.
Not the way I've tasted salt.
How does an orgasm feel for a woman?
First thing we retract is this tissue here.
This is the omentum.
Once that's secured... we move to what's called the vesicouterine fold.
We know what it's called, Bill.
I retract the vesicouterine fold to expose this shiny, grapefruit - sized mass here, which is the uterus.
Is that the end of the lesson?
Listening to our exam room.
There's some money trading hands about what's going on in there.
- I do n't know if you knew that.
I think maybe a decorator is in there now, moving furniture.
If I can make the camera small enough, it'll allow the viewer to actually witness it in real time.
But can you vary the size of the device?
Because this looks big.
And some women can accommodate big much better than others, of course.
I thought we put this matter to bed.
This is work I've been doing on my own time.
An extracurricular hobby, like model building or macramé.
Bill, I said no. I meant no.
What part of that do you not understand?
The part that still believes you're a scientist.
All I am asking is that you take off your management hat for five minutes.
Let me show you what any real scientist would kill to see.
We call it "Ulysses," after the Kirk Douglas movie with the giant cyclops.
It even assists with stimulation.
I do n't like where this is going.
I designed Ulysses myself, using cold - light illumination and with a miniature camera lens attached inside.
Who else is doing this?
Who will be doing it in five years?
I do n't think this is a good idea.
It'll be just like all the other times.
Except the provost of the entire university will be watching me.
He's not watching you.
He's watching science.
Best seat in the house.
Now, the patient controls Ulysses herself.
The only thing you have to do is lean in close, like this, so you get the best possible view through the lens.
But not too close, or you'll get poked in the eye.
Just think of yourself as Sir Edmund Hillary leaving base camp.
Whenever you're ready, J...
Well, it's a remarkable feat.
Which is why it's time to go public, Barton.
Time to submit this proposal to the board.
A study where a naked woman mounts a mechanical phallus!
It's not just the technology.
We've already debunked many established theories, plus charted clear - cut stages of sexual response... four in all.
We're starting to see that some women are capable of multiple orgasms.
Why does your secretary keep talking to me?
I already gave you my answer.
It's not an answer I can accept.
I've made this hospital a fortune.
Our patient base has tripled.
We're ranked second in the country.
Our donors ca n't write checks fast enough, in large part because of me.
I got us to where we are now.
And this study, this is where we're going.
But if you wo n't support me in... in blazing that trail, then I'll find another hospital that will.
Dangerous game you're playing.
Oh, it's not a game.
I need an answer by the end of today.
He's not gonna call.
Ethan, I'm sorry.
You're not even dressed yet.
Is this about the NICU benefit?
For God's sake, Ethan, go ahead.
Gini can come with Libby and me later.
Libby's had me over twice this week.
I'm sure she'd like time alone.
And I would like a date.
So I can wait another 15 minutes.
Well, we have another hour here at least.
I thought you'd broken that off.
You know, this is not research into kidney disease, which might survive some incident of inner-departmental scandal.
So even a hint of impropriety could derail all our work now, everything that's to come.
I understand you're upset about Scully.
I'm not talking about Scully!
Now, given that every museum in the world is filled with art created from this basic impulse, the greatest literature... the most beautiful music.
I'm just so happy that you and Barton made up.
It was n't exactly valentines and roses. But Bill can be very persuasive, as you know.
I persuaded her to marry me.
And now I'm persuading her to find some champagne so we can celebrate.
I'll go with you, Lib.
It's a good day.
I do n't have to show my hand.
I've been asking around about Langham.
He's married, but he's also had affairs.
Maybe I should talk to him.
Langham's a doctor.
I insinuated my way in with you easily enough.
You're forgetting that I picked you for this job.
If that's what you need to tell yourself.
See if you can get him away from his wife.
I'll find you later.
And then you have to lay there, you know, with your legs up around your ears, everything completely exposed.
It hurts, like cramping, only worse.
They've taken my blood so many times, one of my veins has collapsed.
Lib, all of the pain, it will all be worth it.
I think he needs it more than I do.
I mean, not the poking and prodding, of course, but the baby.
Having a wife grounds him, I think.
A child could really change him.
Anyway, it annoys him to no end, but I do apologize every day.
Here he is, this brilliant doctor, stuck with a barren wife.
I'll be back in one moment.
You wanted to know what was going on in room 5.
That's not what this is.
The phase we're considering you for is couples.
M- my wife barely lets me see her naked.
We do n't mean you and your wife.
I'm in the process of recruiting several new female volunteers.
We preserve the anonymity of all of our volunteers.
But I already have a secretary, and I've spoken with a nurse and a hospital administrator's wife.
Only hookers and insane co-eds would agree to this.
Have you signed on?
I am Dr. Masters' associate.
Otherwise, I would have no reservations about volunteering.
All of our subjects know they're advancing the cause of science.
These are young, good - looking women.
Austin, trust me on this.
This whole thing feels like...
Yes, your wife told me.
Your wife, who's been standing by herself at the bar the last 20 minutes.
I'll be back in a moment, gentlemen.
Merry Christmas to us all.
Ethan, let go of me!
You're hurting me!
You ca n't answer, can you?
How many times have we slept together?
Just come back inside with me.
It's not that tough a question.
We are not going to have this conversation now.
When is a good time, Virginia?
Because I have n't seen you in weeks.
You see me every day.
I have n't seen you alone!
You work late every night!
You ride home now with that bow - tied asshole!
It's not an excuse.
Please. Do n't do this.
Do n't not talk to me.
That I do n't like being dragged out here in the cold when you're drunk and insulting?
Why would I insult you when you're all I think about?!
I have been in your bed.
I have been inside you.
What am I not doing?
Or doing too much of?
You know, what can I do better?
Do not say "friend."
People in love with each other, they do.
I care about you, Ethan.
You'll make love to me.
You'll let me do anything, everything to you.
It's because I like it, because you like it.
I do it because I love you.
I'm sorry that I hurt you.
That was never my intention.
Wear the lab coat, Virginia.
Play doctor all you want.
I'm going to have a baby.
That is such happy news.
So, so happy.
Once you two get settled, I will attach the leads.
While we just lay there naked?
There's a sheet, if you're feeling shy.
We'll see how it goes.
That's the fun of being first.
I'm anonymous, too.
I'll take your gowns.
Make yourselves comfortable on the bed.
Now, there really are no rules in terms of what you can and ca n't do.
You simply need to move through all four stages so we can monitor the response.
We start with excitement.
To plateau, which is usually intercourse, but can also be more foreplay.
Then orgasmic... that's self - explanatory, I think.
Ending with refractory, the body's physiological reflexes returning back to normal.
All of this comes very naturally, so I would n't get too in your head about it.
And, uh, all the wires?
I would advise going slowly.
More fun that way.
Now, whenever you two are ready.
Your cheekbone is bruised.
Watch out for open medicine cabinets.
Can I kiss you?
You know, I think we did meet once...
Dr. Shaw's birthday party.
You were the one with clothes on.
I do have one concern... about the possibility of sexual transference between us and our patients.
But the likelihood of us transferring all this libidinous energy onto our patients is high.
Is this something you're struggling with?
No, but I could see the beginnings of it already between you and Langham.
He was flirting with you...
I was trying to make him feel comfortable.
He was sitting there with an erection.
Which is why we need to implement a system, uh, that ensures this kind of transference does n't occur.
It did n't occur.
So you wo n't object to devising a- a system that avoids any doctor / patient conflict.
I wo n't object, but why do n't you just come out and say whatever it is you're trying to say?
The two of us should undertake the research ourselves.
Bill, that would be transference.
We should undertake the research with each other.
I've considered this carefully, and I - I realized it's the best way to ensure the longevity of the project.
We get the benefit of interpreting the data firsthand, plus, it deflects any inappropriate projection away from our patients.
Keeps it just between us.
Can I take the weekend to think about this?
Good night, then.
I walk and watch and listen a witness to all the beauty and ugliness that is disappearing from our beloved city.
Last week took me to the gray depths of the East River where Dimitri Panchenko swims his morning laps like he has every morning since the 1960s.
Today I walked by the acres of scaffolding outside what used to be the Plaza Hotel and I thought about Eloise.
Remember Kay Thompson's Eloise?
Eloise who lived in the Plaza Hotel with her dog Weenie and her parents, who were always away and her English nanny who had eight hairpins made out of bones.
Stories of a city that is disappearing before our eyes.
So, what will be left of those stories?
Are we going to have to construct an imaginary city to house our memories?
Because when you love something, every time a bit of it goes you lose a piece of yourself.
So where's Eloise going to sleep tonight?
"Has anyone seen my turtle, Skipperdee?"
Did Eloise really mean that much to you?
Were n't you ever a little girl?
Not the kind of little girl that remembers the name of her turtle.
I'm just a voice.
The shows are on the website.
People can download them for free.
- What are you wearing?
Green scrubs, tied at the waist, very sexy V- neck.
- How about the sexy green hat?
You like it more than the others, less than the others or the same?
I'm at the place and I wanna make sure you're still okay with the cream and the orange.
Actually, it's not cream.
For tonight, if you meet me at Nicole's art thing you do n't have to talk to anyone but me.
- You're not coming?
I love you too.
The Laundromat is in a town in Jersey where Diane Arbus used to do her laundry.
- Oh, that gun store is down in Chinatown.
Berenice Abbott shot it in the '30s.
It's really evocative, you know?
You have to convince him to come to one of these things.
He ca n't avoid us forever.
Do n't you love this woman?
You guys this, when it starts, it's disgusting.
- We have to go.
I hate you so much.
Are you gonna be that crabby when you get older?
Look, she gave me an apple.
So she is human.
- That was too big a bite.
Do n't give it to him.
Why ca n't we go down to city hall tonight?
She wants the invitations and the band playing and the minister.
That's the nicest thing you ever said to me.
Did he go up there?
Thanks for finding him.
But I get a reward or something?
- You're hurting him!
- Give me the dog.
You just made my day!
- Did you get any sleep?
She was dead on arrival and her fingerprints are all over the gun.
- So he's laughing again.
I'll meet you over there.
- Can I talk to her?
Can I have a word with you?
We're just gonna be right here.
You know, sweetie something you should know.
And if she could, she would tell you that you can trust me.
Did your stepfather hurt your mommy?
You do n't have the right.
And you know how this whole thing works.
You done been through this a thousand times.
You hire your lawyers and you do your thing.
- I heard her show once.
You had the service?
They did n't know when you were going to wake up if you were going to wake up.
You were gone for three weeks.
I wanna see him again.
You gotta help us here.
Let's start over again.
He hit your boyfriend with the pipe.
Once, twice, three times?
You're the good guys.
Please leave a message for David and Erica after the beep.
What kind of case did you have?
My boyfriend was beaten to death.
Do you have a complaint report number?
- And what was his name?
It might be under Erica Bain.
I realize how difficult this can be but if you'd please be patient and have a seat over there an officer will be down shortly to help you.
I realize how difficult it can be but if you'd please be patient and have a seat over there an officer will be down shortly to help you.
Oh, yeah, of course.
I need a license, yeah.
I need to get something now.
I wo n't survive 30 days.
Loads from the handle.
I'll throw in the bullets.
You should n't smoke.
- You should n't be working this late.
You said this was business, Sean.
- You heard about that Murrow thing, right?
Women do n't shoot themselves in the face.
At least in my experience.
Where do they shoot themselves, in your experience?
Jackie, I been chasing after this asshole for three straight years.
And right when his wife was ready to turn state's evidence on him instead of blowing the lid off of him, she blows off her own head.
So what can I do?
Well, she has a daughter.
And her daughter knows something.
But now he's asked for custody of her and then he's gonna get it.
- And you want her made a ward of court.
Sean, I'm your ex-wife.
Try seeing them now.
I can hear you breathing.
Looks like he was a roadie for Aerosmith.
What does that tell us?
Well, she took three in the torso with a .38.
Then somebody smoked him with a 9 mm automatic.
Do n't ask me who, though.
And we found these casings.
- But where's the tape?
And why did n't he take the money?
They chickened out, got scared?
We got three casings, only one hit.
One that has your arms your legs your eyes.
Building sprout - like chromosomes on the DNA of its streets.
I've got two shows that are almost finished.
They're already mixed.
All they need is an intro and an outro, which I could do live.
I've got six shows in various stages.
I've got all these stories in my files.
And I know what I'm doing, and you know that I know what I'm doing.
You've been through so much.
You need more time before you put yourself out there.
- Do n't make me beg.
But we have a public and I'm not sure you're ready for it yet.
You telling me I ca n't work because of what happened?
Look I just need to keep living.
I do n't wanna disappear.
Is there anything we can cut to?
New York like any metropolis is...
Women afraid to walk home alone people afraid of white powder in their mailbox darkness and night.
I always believed that fear belonged to other people.
It never touched me.
And your skin crawls and your heart sickens and you look at the person you once were walking down that street and you wonder, will you?
Hey, what sounds you got up in there, dog?
Do n't nobody talk in New York no more?
Now, you wanna grow up to be like that punk ass?
- I'm keeping this joint.
- You kidding me, right?
So you gonna give me some Radiohead too?
I should have walked out of that train.
I could've just shown them the gun, and they would n't have hurt me.
Why do n't my hands shake?
Why does n't somebody stop me?
We've got two confirmed shot on a subway from Brooklyn. Church Street, lower Manhattan.
Everyone's arguing whose jurisdiction.
Did you check with BCI?
Yeah, I got this printout.
- They here yet?
- And I'll get them to you.
Well, I hope this is their stop.
- I do n't think this is his.
Money in his pocket.
Looks like a 9 mm automatic.
- Like from the other night?
Check it against Brass Catchers, see if it matches.
The kind of guy you would n't even notice.
It's a new investigation.
I'm sorry, but we're not...
Excuse me, do n't I know you?
- What's your name?
It would be about you.
My life's not that interesting.
So you gonna give me some Radiohead too?
How the hell did this get out so quick?
You ever listen to NKW?
- She shows up at the subway last night and guess who she wants to interview?
You should totally do it.
Remember that Bernie Goetz thing?
Hey, is Carter in?
Reporters calling in the night.
Have him call me at my desk.
What's she want with you?
Give her my number.
You know what I want?
I want everyone in the market that night everyone on the subway, outside.
Somebody has to have seen this guy.
- See who it belongs to.
You've been avoiding the full glare of my disapproval.
The show sucked and everybody hated it.
Well, we do n't normally do silence on WNKW.
You almost managed a full minute.
You got 11 more steps, do you?
I thought we were better than some AM confessional but people are responding.
I'm Detective Mercer.
You remember me from last night?
- Yeah, well I saw you in the hospital after...
After what had happened to you and to your friend.
My wife, she used to listen to your show all the time and that was why I stopped you in the subway.
I just wanted you to know that.
You know, it was disturbing.
I mean, you were gone.
And to see somebody that ca n't see you, it...
I know you do.
You see I checked into your case.
- You checked into my case?
We got two of the best detectives in this city that's working on this and we will find them.
Are policemen always so confident?
Are you interviewing me now?
Five minutes, tops.
We can do it over here.
It's amazing what a dead body can tell you.
So the dead do talk?
And those bodies at the subway, what are they telling you?
Why do I know him?
That's Mr. Murrow.
He owns the parking out on Roosevelt Island.
What else does he do?
- You really wanna know?
Whatever's in demand.
Found three guys that had crossed him with their hands Superglued to a table and expanding cement in their throats.
Now he's got custody of his stepdaughter and not for sentimental reasons. But he knows she knows something and I hate to think what's gonna happen to her.
But maybe you know a nicer side.
And why ca n't you nail him?
Because I follow the law.
Well, there's nothing you can do?
So there's nothing you can do?
No matter how bad I feel about it.
I petitioned that she be made a ward of the court but his lawyers killed that one stone dead, so...
Did your hands shake?
A benefit that that asshole and the subway shooter do n't have.
And you think they're the same?
Let me ask you a question.
How did you pull it back together after what happened to you?
You become someone else.
You must have loved him very much.
Sometimes that just makes it harder, you know.
You just wish you did n't.
That's my card.
But am I finding them or are they finding me?
So, what would 50 dollars do for you?
- Should n't she be at home?
- She got no home.
- You're looking for a show in the back seat?
What's your name, honey?
Are you a mommy?
You know them suicide bombers over in Iraq?
When they die they want 72 virgins.
I want them while I'm alive.
- You ai n't going nowhere.
How long have you been in it?
But you wanna go now, do n't you?
Then I'll be the last supercunt you'll ever see.
Go on. Not until he pays me.
I went there from Albuquerque.
Well, you got enough money to get you home now.
You're okay, come on.
Let me turn you over.
Who the hell are you?
There is no going back to that other.
You walking out the heat?
Your hands are cold as ice.
You never said my name before.
I heard your show.
Ballistic tests have linked last night's shooting with the shooting from the market and the shooting from the subway, so...
Are you saying the same gun was used in all three shootings?
Sources are saying the witness can provide a description but has refused to talk.
Now, thank you, that's everything.
So, what, is this guy becoming an obsession with you?
Yeah, well, ai n't nobody doing my job for me.
You heard my show.
You gotta think every one of those reporters in that room is gonna sensationalize this.
How can you tell?
Well, you do n't fit our audience profile.
How's the girl doing?
- No, that's incitement.
- Wish he'd take care of my ex.
- You think that's funny?
I suppose you think lethal injection's funny too.
I'm thinking about opening up your show.
You mean the shootings?
- You really think that that's appropriate?
But you're good at it.
- I'm not asking you to personalize it.
No more than you already have.
The essential American soul is hard isolate, stoic, and a killer.
It has never yet melted. "
I quote that from D.H. Lawrence because someone is playing God out there killing in the name of justice, in this the safest big city in the world.
This is a new departure for us but we wanna hear from you so call 212-165-9990.
Because no matter what the media tells us crimes are being committed, and he's cleaning it up.
And you think he has the right to do that.
You're talking about murder.
The vigilante is just like the people he's killing.
He should be in jail.
That's why we have war, why we got the death...
- I think it's good for New York.
I mean, this city was turning into Disneyland.
- We're getting our street cred back.
You're on the air.
I wonder if the vigilante has a girlfriend because there's something sexy about...
And if he's listening, my number is 2...
- This is the vigilante calling.
I'm the man that takes care of business.
- I need to talk to someone.
- Ma'am, can I help you?
- No "Erica Bain" under homicide.
You gonna give me some Radiohead too?
- Because I could not stop for Death...
... he kindly stopped for me.
The carriage held but just ourselves.
- Is everything okay?
What do you do when you ca n't sleep?
- Is n't that hard?
Well, come on, what's happening?
Did you sleep better when your wife was beside you?
So I called her a mackerel.
I guess that's not the worst thing in the world to wake up to.
You've been good to me.
You told me it'd be there and it better be.
Why do you think you can hurt people?
- Just do damage and walk away.
Do n't you know what you leave behind?
- Do I know you?
- Do you think about it?
Does it keep you up at night?
Are you one of them press paparazzo freaks?
Well, it looks like he fell from up there.
Cause of death could be the fall. It could be the crowbar stuck in his skull.
I'd say 50 - 50 either way.
Maybe 70 - 30.
How many people wanted this prick dead?
The problem is he knew all of them.
He would n't let anybody get this close to him.
You think someone did us a favor?
Maybe we should put him on the payroll.
What, like someone think they're doing our job for us?
- I ca n't because...
What kind of trouble are you in?
You do n't wanna know.
Were you a nurse?
When I had to be.
I killed a man tonight.
Because he did this to you?
I would've killed him anyway.
Back home they gave young boys guns.
Made them kill their parents.
Anyone can be a killer.
Each death leaves a hole waiting to be filled.
Did the ME come back with his liver temperature yet?
Dead about two hours from when we got there.
- About 1:00, give or take.
Okay, I want everyone from the subway and from that market killing I want them all brought in again.
- We've done all of that.
We need to do it again.
What about the iPod?
You said it traced back to a kid.
I thought I told you.
No, I just wanna know how you slept. Hey, you wanna see what I do?
Now sit your hippie ass down.
- I need to talk to you.
Does your dad know you smoke grass, huh?
That's a lot more than a misdemeanor these days.
So, what time you got to sleep last night?
Yeah. I ended up working all night.
You know you're not gonna be able to reference this on your show?
We're gonna interview a witness to a shooting.
- Is n't that against procedure?
But I've tried to talk to her twice and she seemed real nervous to talk to me.
I figure maybe if you were there, she'll talk.
Because you got me to talk.
How are we feeling today?
So you feel like telling me what happened to you that night now?
You should tell them what you saw.
Whatever it was, tell them the truth.
And nobody saw me.
Sorry if that upset you.
Well, I'm sorry that I could n't be more help back there.
She sure liked your necklace.
It meant a lot to me.
- Why'd you call me last night?
I told you, I could n't sleep.
And you were in bed?
You wanna tell us again why you did n't wanna come in?
To get back my i Pod?
- You were glad?
I know I should n't be, but I was.
Those guys smacked me around and took my iPod.
Yeah, just a woman.
Can you describe this woman well enough for an artist to make a sketch?
Where are you going with this woman thing?
Just think about the first moment that you met her.
Where you were, where she was.
Tell me anything that comes to mind.
But she had some ass.
You know, you could tell because...
Like, they were little, like Kate Moss titties.
- But they looked good with...
- Hey, you know what I do remember?
You left a hole in me.
But I'm done now.
I knew he was bullshitting us.
The mind gets so saturated with popular images it's often difficult, especially for people under 20, to recall something unique.
He owns the parking out on Roosevelt Island.
That's not all he does.
- You really wanna know?
- Where'd you find it?
A uniform pinched the suspect's girlfriend trying to pawn it.
He fit the description that you gave.
I need a favor from you.
I'll get my stuff.
Do you recognize anyone?
Where do you know them from?
And what did they do?
Number one, approach the mirror.
Damn, I thought we had him.
You think she just froze up?
I was kind of hoping I was finally done.
I can barely remember his hands.
Perhaps you need to forget.
I miss who I was with him.
You know that feeling?
You know this is Mughal.
It was a gift from David's grandmother.
You know, someone gave me a gift the other night.
You recall that guy we saw on TV at the coffee shop?
The one I've been trying to put away for three years.
Apparently somebody else must've had something against him because we're not talking about a 9 mm here.
I would ask myself, if there was someone that I knew that had committed a crime would I have the fortitude to put them away?
I always hoped that I would have the courage and the dedication to say yes.
It's what I admire about you.
And I'm sure you'll find it.
You're a good detective.
Hey. - I wonder what David would think of...
Hey, can I get Joey Mortell?
I got you stuck in traffic, 88th and 3rd Avenue.
Get yourself a slice.
- You are gonna be there that long because I got traffic backed up on 3rd all the way to 96th Street.
- Make yourself comfortable.
Can you run a trace on a call?
And I do n't have a subpoena.
But you'll get one, right?
Two days ago, July 20th between 12 and 1:30 a.m.
-... 157 - 1431.
You seen this ring before?
What'd she look like?
- Do you know this number?
Hey, you guys, are 917...
- Are you Shauna?
- Did you just call me?
- Tell me where he is!
I saw what they did to you.
Did she tell you she was someplace else?
Keep this to yourself until I can get that subpoena.
- 90 Clayton Avenue.
- Do n't you know there's a leash law?
I made your boyfriend smile.
- You think you can come after me, huh?
- Stay out of this!
- This is between him and me!
Now give me the gun.
- You gonna arrest him?
- Give me the gun.
- Give me the gun, I said.
- Ai n't nobody talking to you.
You can take me now.
You see, there was never any vigilante.
It was just three punks out on a killing spree.
They got a taste for it up in Central Park.
And they bought themselves a gun.
And somehow I got winged and I did what I had to do.
- You only shoot bad guys?
I've joined that club.
Now you get out of here before I lose my temper.
Well, Francis and I are only halfway there, but I bet you know your husband as well as you know yourself.
I know what keeps him up at night.
How can I ensure a better future for my family?
You know what he said to me last night?
I want to be able to look every single American in the eye, and know that I have made their lives better. "
I have to say, Mrs. Underwood, I find you very charming. And you seem quite honest.
But I have trouble believing that your husband truly cares about people.
He's dedicated and generous.
And I have 28 years of proof.
And I can honestly say, even if I was n't married to him, he would definitely have my vote.
What do these five fingers have in common?
Mr. King, I would like to respond to that.
This is a man who believes in the rule of law - ish.
Is this the man who should be president?
Ms. Dunbar, like any good lawyer, you have a knack for rhetoric- ish.
But the American people are tired of words.
What they crave is action.
My concern about focusing on the word, "action," is that she'll just come back with failed actions.
America Works, the UN mission.
"Action" performed well with key demos in our last poll.
We have been saying, "A vote for Frank Underwood is a vote for America Works."
You need a word that goes beyond America Works. - Something that can be used for anything.
- Remy, what do you think?
- We're talking about the word, "action."
My mind was on the foreign policy argument.
- What about "vision"?
Is n't that too generic?
That's what we want.
People can project anything they want on "vision."
I'll get it polled before tomorrow.
We should work on Sharp next.
Thank you for taking your role so seriously, Donald.
You should consider a career on the stage.
Because he sure as hell is n't gonna be on my ticket.
You're good at this.
Three decades of campaigns, you learn how to read an audience.
Self - promotion gives me hives.
Honestly, I do n't know how you do it.
I'm promoting my husband, not myself.
That's a convenient way to spin it, do n't you think?
Are you always this blunt?
I only have two days to tag along.
Mind if I ride with you, since we have so little time?
I need to make some calls.
Maybe we'll find some time later.
Remy, you were distracted earlier.
I need you on your A - game, Remy.
This debate could make us the front - runner.
It's just between the campaign and managing the White House, - I'm a little burnt out.
- We still have months to go. - A year before the general.
If you can do it, I can.
You still ca n't believe she's dead, can you?
Cause she's not.
She's alive, and I know exactly where she is.
I've known for a while.
- Look on your laptop.
you showed me the picture. - Of her body.
- That was n't her.
I forged it all so you'd lift my passport lock.
But my friend is n't.
Get him the same deal you got me, all charges dropped.
You do that, and I'll tell you where she is.
- Hey, Meechum.
Thank you for coming all the way to Andrews.
Did Remy walk you through the broad strokes?
No matter the policy question, foreign or domestic, we hammer Dunbar's lack of experience.
We can not say "lack of experience" enough.
And no doubt, she'll bring up Claire's recess appointment, where I ca n't take the bait, so I leave that entirely to you.
This was one of the things that I was hoping to discuss.
Oh, you do n't want to call her "sexist"?
- The argument does n't hold.
She says that Claire was unqualified.
You say she would n't say that about a man with the same CV.
And calling another woman sexist when there's a man on the stage --
And who else is better but you to call her out on what she's done for women, which is absolutely nothing?
Whereas gender - equality legislation is one of your hallmarks.
But it could hurt me more than it hurts her.
You were gonna play pit bull while I play presidential.
Will you get a little bloody?
But that's what people want in their debates.
And then you and I together, we bury her.
You drop out next week, endorse me and the race is over.
I have no problem being forceful.
- I really do n't want to involve them.
But there has to be another way.
She wants to trumpet an equal playing field?
Then why does she send her own kids to private school?
That is a clear and simple argument that everyone can get their heads around.
And it does n't hurt that Iowa's biggest employer is the public school system.
Alan sends his kids to private school.
Yeah, but they're not your kids.
They're my step - kids. And that makes me a hypocrite.
Is that really what you're concerned about?
It's my family.
Oh, trust me, they'll understand the moment they step into the White House.
Jackie, I really should n't have to convince you to do what it takes to get a set of keys.
I'll be the pit bull, Mr. President.
- The press has boarded, sir.
- All right, make sure no one sees her.
Such a pity how much ruthless pragmatism gets weighed down by family values.
Without her doctor and his pimply - faced brood, she could soar as high as this plane.
Oh, I know, the marriage was my idea.
What, did you get locked out or something?
I felt the need to drink.
I got this far and I stopped myself.
I wanted you to see it.
That I could control it.
You wanna go back up?
There was this girl...
So I started drinking.
I tried to shut her out, but I just kept checking my e-mails, my text messages.
It needed to stop.
What matters is that you got pushed to the edge today and you did n't fall off.
You did what you had to do.
And I do n't think it's crazy.
We could've met somewhere a little warmer.
Walmart wanted to knock this down, build a store here.
Because they would n't give a tax credit unless entry - level wages were higher.
- Well, I think I know your answer.
Jackie, you have repeatedly opposed the minimum - wage and CEO salary bill - I asked the leadership to introduce.
- I've put a lot of thought into it.
This community took a stand.
If enough of them do, Congress wo n't have a choice but to act.
Are we here to talk about legislation?
Because we both have a debate in six hours.
I want to endorse you.
I'll lay off you tonight.
You and I attack Underwood.
In three days, I'll drop out and endorse.
- We have n't even had the first caucus.
I have 14 points in Iowa, twelve in New Hampshire.
You get my people, you have a clear win in both states.
How much does Underwood value it?
- What did he offer you?
I'm more interested in what you have to offer.
Did he promise a cabinet position?
He offered to put you on the ticket, did n't he?
I would n't expect to be on your ticket, Heather.
I was thinking Secretary of Defense, given my war record.
But I'd be open to other ideas.
I would love your support, Jackie, but I offer you nothing.
I'm not gonna start selling off cabinet positions before I've won the White House.
Those decisions will be based purely on merit.
If I'm gonna lock up this nomination for you, I deserve to be compensated.
I plan on winning, Jackie.
Then I'm sticking with Underwood.
Is Jackie in here?
The patient almost did n't make it.
- But he's alive?
- Do you like?
- What'd she offer?
She could lock this up.
I have to say, I almost... respect it.
Anyway, you were right.
Stick with the devil you know.
Are the kids watching tonight?
They've got all their friends over at the house.
You can mess up my hair all you want after the debate.
Thank all of you so very much for working so hard to make sure we take New Hampshire.
It is field offices like this that win primaries, and the president wants you to know how much your dedication means to us.
- Now, who's ready to watch a debate?
There is a large crowd here in Sioux City tonight.
I would say potential voters, but of course, here in Iowa, citizens caucus instead of vote, and many of the people here in this room will be doing just that on January 15th.
A CNN ORC poll has it as a tight race between the two front - runners.
Heather Dunbar at 32 percent.
President Frank Underwood at 30 percent.
Congresswoman Jackie Sharp trails in third at 14 percent. Twenty - two percent remain undecided.
You can switch it.
- Unless you want to watch.
- No, I thought you would.
It's your last night here.
I want to spend it with my brother, not Frank Underwood.
What do you want to watch instead?
If you're a clean freak, this'll definitely make you a germ freak.
- I love this movie.
I'm John King and I'll be your moderator tonight.
Our debate will be divided in two parts, the first part focusing on foreign policy, part two focusing on the domestic agenda.
I will ask one candidate a question. That candidate will have one minute to answer.
After that, all of our candidates can engage in an open conversation lasting for five minutes.
We begin, though, with opening statements.
And by lottery, it was decided that President Underwood goes first.
I believe that I have shown a clear vision to this country with America Works, the most comprehensive jobs program in nearly a century.
We showed it could work in Washington DC.
We need now to take what we did there and spread it nationwide, so that the American dream can become the American reality.
But that vision is n't enough on its own.
You need someone with experience to make it happen.
And between my time in Congress and now at the White House, I have more experience than both of my opponents combined.
And, uh, when you hire someone for a job, are you gonna hire someone with 30 years' experience, or someone with less than ten or someone with no experience at all?
Where I come from down south, we call that as clear as a glass of moonshine.
Well, I agree with the president.
Vision and experience are exactly what America needs.
You can call America Works visionary, but in truth, it is just an ultra-conservative agenda that's been around for decades.
Dismantle the safety net and hang people out to dry.
As for the president's experience, he was in the leadership during one of the most ineffective decades in Congressional history.
As president, he has failed at everything he's done.
America Works was illegal in the minds of many legal experts, myself included.
His Jordan Valley plan was a disaster.
If that's what you call experience, you're not just padding the résumé, you are fabricating it.
President Underwood is n't presenting us with a vision, he is convincing himself of his own delusion.
Now, my vision is to tackle corporate greed, raise pay for those who need it most, and create jobs by growing the economy, not robbing people of their retirement and health care.
My experience is 20 years defending the Constitution.
You know when I take my presidential oath, I will mean every word of it.
Ms. Dunbar, thank you.
As many of you know, I am a US Army veteran.
Now, I've seen firsthand the great sacrifices my fellow servicemen and women have made defending this country.
But how can we ask them to protect a system that is n't protecting us?
Take women, for example.
There are two women at this debate running for president.
But out in the general workforce?
Even worse is minority women earning 67 cents on the dollar.
Now, Ms. Dunbar can talk about balancing the scales, but she inherited a multi-billion - dollar fortune and never had to earn any cents on the dollar.
Now, I do n't agree with everything that President Underwood has done or proposes, but at least he knows what it means to work for a living.
I can give you even better than that.
I know what it means to fight for a living.
And I will fight for fairness here at home just as fiercely as I fought our enemies overseas.
Let's move to part one: foreign policy.
And the first question is for you, Mr. President.
Given the recent volatile events in the Jordan Valley, do you still believe it was correct to assemble the United Nations coalition and to intervene, or is it time now to call that intervention a mistake?
Well, I will answer that question, John, but I'd like to address first something Ms. Dunbar said a few moments ago.
America Works is not some stale, old, conservative agenda.
You name me one Republican who has suggested using federal funds to guarantee jobs for every American who wants one and I will eat my hat.
This is n't about dismantling government. It is about --
Are n't we supposed to be talking about foreign policy?
Because it's easier to talk about America Works than to defend your indefensible UN mission.
At least I have a record to defend, Ms. Dunbar.
Speaking of your record, Mr. President, you went on record saying you would n't run for president. - And yet here you are.
- John, it seems that your very thoughtful rules have gone out the window.
You have no respect for rules, Mr. President.
Take FEMA, for example.
Oh, you want to talk about FEMA now instead of foreign policy.
I am just following your lead, sir.
See what a mess we get into when we follow your brand of leadership?
Well, I must admit that Ms. Dunbar does have many years of experience making rhetorical arguments in court.
You've just seen proof of that today.
But serving the American people is not about what you say, it's about what you do.
I have to agree that Ms. Dunbar's lack of experience is a concern.
I find it ironic that the president talks about the importance of experience, given the fact that he appointed his wife UN ambassador - despite her utter lack of credentials.
- That's a sexist comment.
You would n't be making that argument if a female president had appointed her husband.
A husband with the same lack of international affairs experience as Claire Underwood?
In fact, it makes me question your advocacy for women in general.
Well, that's ridiculous.
What have you done to further gender equality?
What have you done to balance the scales?
But that is simply not true.
Can, can you name one specific thing?
Being a woman, who has served as Solicitor General, one of the few in the history of the court.
Well, that advanced your interests, but what did that do for 150 million women out there?
The very fact that a woman can hold that position --
- So you are a symbol.
Me and many other women, including yourself --
Okay, but how does that get us from 77 cents on the dollar to 100?
Well, now you're just aping the president's rhetoric.
How could you possibly misconstrue my words?
I speak for myself.
I am not aping the president or any other man.
I'm sorry, I wo n't engage with this --
And you need to confront the fact that you do not have women's best interests at heart.
John, this is getting out of hand.
We are in the foreign policy portion of this debate. Ms. Dunbar, let me bring this question to you.
You're critical of the president. You say it's indefensible, what he has done in the Jordan Valley.
But specifically, what would you do differently?
Well, John, I'm glad you asked that.
- I need to go back to the hotel.
I really wish I could stay, but I have a very full day tomorrow. I should rest up.
But again, I want to thank you all for your hospitality and all of your hard work.
Good night, everyone.
Oh, you should go back inside with the volunteers and have the full campaign experience.
I did n't come to New Hampshire for that.
I came to speak with you.
My brain is a bit fried.
Is it what Sharp said? Why you do n't want to watch anymore?
- The sexist comment?
- Oh, I honestly do n't care.
Who can get the most points, right?
And the first question goes to you, Congresswoman.
The President speaks of America Works.
Ms. Dunbar wants to raise minimum wage. Talks about regulating executive pay.
But a lot of people are n't quite clear about your economic policy.
What specifically, I underscore "specifically," would you do if elected president?
First and foremost, I want to press for gender equality and close the salary gap.
If half of the working population has more money in their pockets, that will catalyze spending, which will grow the economy, which will, in turn, create more jobs.
I think that gender equality is very important.
And under my AmWorks program, there will be a provision that all A mWorks jobs, there can be no discrepancy in pay between men and women.
AmWorks jobs, that's the government.
What about the rest of the private sector?
We have to start by leading by example, then we introduce --
If America Works is how you lead by example...
If that is how you lead by example, then are we to assume that everyone should illegally raid funds that they have no right to use?
Everyone should start robbing banks?
Holding up liquor stores?
Now, Ms. Dunbar, with all due respect, you can criticize my programs as much as you want, but to accuse me of illegal activity --
One thing you ca n't deny is that I am much more of an authority on the Constitution than you are, Mr. President.
Ms. Dunbar, all three of us on this stage have taken oaths of office.
I would have to say that we have all defended the Constitution.
You do n't have some special claim on the Constitution.
The Constitution belongs to everyone in this room and every citizen in the United States.
But I would ask Ms. Sharp, you voted in favor of dismantling America Works.
Was that because you thought it was in fact, as Ms. Dunbar says, illegal?
I voted for dismantlement because I wanted to make sure we were prepared for the hurricane, not because I thought your reading of the Stafford Act was illegal per se.
Honestly, you think the president had a right to do what he did?
It's an appropriations issue, not a legal one.
He basically walked into FEMA and said,
"Stick'em up and show me where the vault is."
So now I'm a bank robber.
Six Gun Underwood, what they call me in South Carolina.
I'm sorry, but I do not find this funny.
We put 50,000 people to work in Washington DC.
With money she never earned, but which she inherited.
Now, it is easy to talk about the problems of the poor with a silver spoon in your mouth.
Am I well - off?
So was FDR when he developed the New Deal.
Since when does one's income determine one's amount of empathy?
Would you send your kids to public school?
Let's keep our children out of this.
You want your kids to have a head start, to have an advantage over the kids in public schools.
Lots of Americans, of all ranges of income, choose to send their children to private or parochial schools.
But is n't it true that you want your children to have a leg up on everyone else?
Is that balancing the scales? Or is that hypocrisy?
Or maybe it's that you did n't want to raise them yourself so you sent them to boarding school.
You must really want to be president.
I would never in a million years bring up your children in a debate.
The way you choose to raise them is your business.
Do I want the best for my kids?
I imagine you're the same way.
Well, I'm sure you're both excellent mothers. But perhaps we should get back to some --
Congresswoman Sharp raised the issue of sexism earlier.
Now, it is an important point, and we need to address it.
The Congresswoman is correct in saying that all aspects of it should be illegal.
And then, she accused me of being sexist for criticizing Claire Underwood.
But would n't that same logic hold true for you, Ms. Sharp?
Would you have come after my kids if I were a man?
Are n't you trying to paint the picture that I'm a bad mother, shipping my kids off to some far - flung place?
Because you know if you can make me seem like a bad mother, then how could anyone possibly support me?
That's not hardball, that is just disgusting.
Well, I have to say I do think Ms. Dunbar has a point.
I mean, speaking of hypocrisy, do n't you send your own kids to private school, Congresswoman?
- What was your point?
John, I think I've said all I need to say on this subject.
Next question goes to you, Ms. Dunbar.
Most of them give Frank Underwood the win. Not by a lot.
But did he do enough to overtake Dunbar, become the front - runner?
George, I do n't think it's so much what Underwood did, but what he did n't do.
And when the attacks came his way, he held the high ground.
Now, Dunbar and Sharp, they came out swinging, and I think it hurt them both.
Yeah, but Sharp had to do something.
She's 20 points behind the other two.
But the sexism thing? And going after Dunbar's kids?
- It seemed quite desperate.
I do n't know about that. Dunbar could've fared far worse.
She took it on the chin, held her own, and in my opinion, it was a tie.
But bottom line, does this debate change anything?
Does it affect the caucus, does it affect the primary in New Hampshire?
Let's not forget that it's remarkable that a sitting president is n't considered the front - runner to begin with.
- He said she's not picking up, sir.
Would you like me to have him knock on her door?
No, that's all right.
You have n't said a word.
Well, you've been prepping for days.
I thought you might want a break from talking.
You're disappointed in me.
That the kids got mentioned.
Probably thrilled... that they got mentioned at all.
If I'm disappointed in anyone, it's him, for throwing you under the bus.
I gotta fly back with you tonight.
Do n't you have events tomorrow?
Thank you all for coming in.
All right, I'll give you some privacy.
This should only take 15 minutes. - So just holler out if you need anything.
Pull up a chair.
We can talk while this finishes up.
I should be doing this, too.
I'm sure we could get another lawn chair in here.
I was a junkie once upon a time.
What would you call this color?
Scarlet is n't right.
It's not crimson or maroon.
No, I know that.
But you know she always tells everyone she bakes them herself and I know she does n't.
Thank you for your support.
Is there some reason we could n't do this by phone?
This needed to be in person.
Yes, but you canceled all your events.
I want to talk about the debate.
She spent half the debate on the defensive.
- I humiliated myself.
- You got a little beat up, that's all.
- And you threw the biggest punch.
- Oh, you mean the thing about your kids?
That was n't what we discussed.
I had to hit you hard so she would n't.
I'm not comfortable with the dynamic we've established.
What dynamic is that?
The leash you have me on.
How I'm supposed to roll over and do any trick you want.
You're taking me for granted.
How fortunate I am to have you "sort of" on my team?
You're not "happy" with our dynamic?
Well, I'm not happy with your attitude.
If anything, you're taking me for granted.
- We had a deal, Jackie.
But do not be under any illusions.
This is not a partnership of equals.
If you are to be my vice president, you will do what I ask.
And we will not have this conversation every time you feel uncomfortable with what I ask you to do, or how I choose to conduct myself.
- Are we still sticking to the timeline?
Are we still sticking to the timeline? I drop out next week?
I see no reason why you should n't.
- Thank you, Mr. President.
- See you in Iowa.
Why did you change your hair back to blonde?
That's your burning question?
How does that help the book?
But right now, I got nothing.
We changed it because blonde polls better with the voters.
You hate it, do n't you?
They feed off the energy.
You are literally giving your blood.
Plenty of people give blood who are n't married to politicians.
Very few people campaign for someone who just fired them.
He tell you that?
He said he betrayed you.
Three days later, you change your hair back to blonde and resign so you can, quote, "devote yourself to the campaign."
I did the math.
Does that bother you?
Just a little light - headed.
You ever have that feeling?
Do you need me to get someone?
He proposed and I said...
I said seven years.
If it's still good, another seven.
I do n't hate campaigning.
How much you need each other?
I did n't jump.
I did n't step back.
- She passed out.
Mrs. Underwood? Can you hear me?
So all these three girls, they got a different papi or what?
They got the blonde, they got the redhead, they got the brunette.
And that's Petticoat Junction, right?
- May we speak privately?
- Sir, if you do n't mind.
Jackie just stopped by my office.
I think we need to take her views more into consideration.
- She's being ridiculous.
- I think she made some valid points.
Who do you work for, me or her?
I'm just trying to communicate her concerns.
She'd better get in line and so had you.
I'm never gonna win if I have to spend my time explaining myself to my subordinates.
- No, no. Now, Freddy, sit down.
Do you remember when we talked about how you treat your staff?
You want to win?
You sure as hell wo n't do it without any of them.
You keep on like this, you wo n't have any of them left.
The only brand of that I accept is unconditional.
- Y'all should put this on pay -per-view.
But this sucker, I've seen him go through a rack of ribs like it was wet tissue.
- Who'd you put your money on?
- She passed out giving blood.
She's okay, but, uh, Mr. Yates is on the line.
I'll take it in my private study.
Do n't do no good calling 'a man out like that.
- Could you do me a favor?
I got work to do and he needs company.
Back at the ribs joint, I could just walk back in the kitchen when I got tired of hearing him talk.
I'll tell him your boss came over.
- Thank you, brother.
Put her on the phone with me.
She did n't want me to call, but I thought I should.
- Well, is she nearby?
- I think she's embarrassed.
I'm her husband.
The nurses are with her.
Maybe you should just hold off for a few minutes.
Tell the head of her detail to get her on the plane right away.
She has to come back here and see the White House physician.
My guess is she'd be even more embarrassed if she had to cancel her events.
This is n't about how she feels.
This is about what's best for her.
She does n't need a doctor.
Listen, just because I may have shared with you a few things about our marriage does not give you the right to interfere with it.
Now, please have her call me when she's ready.
The whole world can fall apart in sixty days.
Or a guy can get sober.
I washed my hands for ten minutes last night before bed.
You turned me from an alcoholic to a germaphobe.
That's not a bad trade - off.
They mean nothing compared to the last eight weeks you've been here with me.
You would have done the same for me.
I'd like to think so.
Call me when you land.
Jesus, you sound like Sarah.
So we want to focus on ad - buys more in the Quad Cities market, less so in Des Moines.
You're stronger in the East and we want to turn our twos there into ones.
I'm sorry, what?
Are you good if we change the stump to focus on the "vision" theme?
We have you going to Iowa.
I know, but I want to change the schedule.
In every campaign, there comes a time for taking stock. A time for soul - searching.
If the goal is a safer, more prosperous America, I do n't need to run for us to achieve that.
All I need to do and what I encourage all of my supporters to do is to help elect Heather Dunbar to the White House.
Yeah, I wonder what she offered her.
You knew about this?
You should call the president.
I found her in a shoebox in New York City.
Oh, I was terribly scared.
- I did n't know you were coming.
She does n't either.
"So there I was, not knowing what to believe.
Should I leave Tina in the shoebox or set Tina free? "
- Leave her in the box!
- Set her free!
Sir, Mr. Grayson needs to speak with you.
- Tell him I'll call him back.
- He says it's important.
I'm with my wife.
I do n't know what to do!
You should n't do anything.
MAN: 13th of July, 4:50 p.m.
I know that means little at this point. But I am.
And I know you knew this. In each of your ways.
It's inexcusable really, I know that now.
How it could have taken this long to admit that, I'm not sure, but it did.
I will miss you.
This is the Virginia Jean with an SOS call.
We're riding towards Absolution.
You know how far west we are?
Is there a reason you're not answering my question?
He's got iron on his wrist.
He's been shot.
Might be worth bounty money.
It's not your lucky day, stranger.
Turn around and start walking.
I said turn around and start walking!
Palms to heaven, friend.
Turn around, nice and slow.
I've been shot.
Only two kinds of men get shot, criminals and victims.
Which one are you?
You got a name, friend?
I do n't know that either.
Just what do you know?
Six days a week it is.
Seventh belongs to the Almighty.
Where'd you ride in from, son?
Well, that's a big place, the west.
Come on into the light here, son.
All right, this might sting a bit.
Is this a mining town?
Well, that was the notion.
People moved on, though.
All right now, try and hold still.
This is no gunshot.
Where'd you get this, son?
I ca n't rightly absolve you of your sins if you do n't recall'em, can I?
That being said, I've seen good men do bad things and bad men do good things.
Whether you're gonna end up in heaven or hell, it's not God's plan, it's your own.
You just got to remember what it was.
All right, put me a finger right here.
Well, not bad for a country preacher.
It's that damn fool Dolarhyde kid.
What are you doing, Percy?
There's people up there!
No one's up there.
It's not fine.
It's bad enough he drinks for free.
Now he has to shoot up the place?
What was that, Doc?
He did n't say anything.
Please, please, go back inside.
I want to hear what you said.
"It's bad enough" what?
Cause if it was n't for my pa's cattle, there'd be no money going through this town!
There'd be no meat on your tables!
And your doors would be closed!
I do n't mean no disrespect to your father, Percy.
But you're asking me to pay.
Come here, let's settle up.
Hey, kid, I do n't want any trouble.
Better pick up your glasses, Doc, before someone steps on them.
I'll pay the goddamn bill!
All right, son!
You know what, preacher?
You just gave me an idea.
I know it ai n't Sunday, folks, but what say we take up a collection for the poor man?
Now, who's got money?
Now, I'm sorry Doc's bad fortune has to be taken out on you good people. In the hat.
That's mighty Christian of you.
You want to watch where you point that thing before you get hurt.
Where the hell did he come from?
He came out of nowhere.
And he dry - gulched me.
It was n't my fault, Sheriff.
Damn it, Percy.
You crossed the line this time.
I gotta lock you up.
You know that's not a good idea.
Well, I'm afraid I got no choice, Nat.
I'll tell your father about what happened today.
Tell you what, Ed.
Next time, you can make the coffee.
Why do n't you take it easy on that Taos Lightning, Murphy?
Mr. Dolarhyde do n't like drinking on the job.
Mr. Dolarhyde do n't like drinking on the job?
I do n't care how many Indians he put under neither.
You sure do flap your gums a lot when the boss ai n't around.
I'd say it to his face if he was here!
I'm gonna tell you something, boys.
Money makes you soft.
Where the hell's that coach?
You shot a deputy, Percy.
Federal Marshal's bringing you to Santa Fe.
Sheriff, have you lost your mind?
My pa is on his way down here.
You better let me out of here before things get out of hand.
Sheriff, it was an accident!
It's not like I'm Jesse James!
Could you put that on Percy's tab?
Just kidding with you, there, Doc.
Why is there no soap in here?
Why do you put the dirty dishes over here?
I like'em over here.
Why do n't you rest?
I got no respect in this town.
I just did n't want you to get shot, that's all.
You want to leave?
This is your dream.
I'd follow you anywhere.
I thought it was our dream.
Hey, Charlie, why do n't you play something festive?
It's like a funeral in here!
What are you doing with me, anyway?
Why do n't you be with somebody who can protect you?
I ca n't even protect myself.
Hey, you do n't have to prove anything, okay?
I'm not a child.
On the house, for what you did.
I'm just here to drink.
My name's Ella.
Where'd you get your bracelet?
There something you know about me, lady?
You do n't remember anything, do you?
I know you're looking for something.
Well, good luck to you.
You mind following me over to the office, so we can have us a little chat?
I think you've got the wrong man.
Would n't do that if I was you.
You're in trouble now.
My pa is coming for me.
He learned how to kill a man good and slow in the war.
I am going to watch you suffer for a long, long, long time.
You thought that cheap shot in the pecker hurt?
I did n't kill your cattle.
You got to believe me!
You do n't maybe know who you're dealing with, Roy.
Them that did are mostly dead.
So you, Ed and Little Mickey is picking up strays.
How many did you get?
Got 24 of 'em, boss.
You been drinking, ai n't you?
I can smell it on you.
I ai n't been drinking.
It's them other two's that drinked.
You could n't do no better?
There was white lights!
There was bright lights!
So there was this big light, and you fell in the river and when you come back, two of my best hands has just disappeared.
There were n't no storm.
You do n't respect me, do you, Roy?
Taggart locked him up, boss.
What'd he do now?
What the hell does Taggart think he's doing?
He would n't even have a job if I...
Now I got to go in there and reason with him!
Cause you failed to look after my boy!
Everybody, saddle up.
Boss, we ought to get more hands.
You're not gonna believe this, but I think Jake Lonergan's in town.
I'm turning you over to the Federal Marshal.
You're gonna tell me what I am charged with?
It says you robbed the stage last month with Pat Dolan and Bull McCade.
Which makes you accessory to every law they broke, too.
Prostitute out of Cottonwood Grove, next county over.
You saying I killed this woman?
Now, I will treat you with respect, but make no mistake,
if you try to escape, I will put a bullet in you.
Taggart, what are you doing?
Sheriff, this is going too far.
I was just fooling around.
Look, I did n't mean to hurt anybody.
Listen, I'm sorry, but I had no choice.
I could n't let you leave.
Well, I'm leaving now.
You got something to say, say it.
I need to know where you came from.
You two lovebirds have a nice trip now.
Taggart, let me out of here!
I have to, Emmett.
It's my job.
Your pa's getting things in order.
When he does he'll send for you.
It's been a year.
Do n't worry, he will.
And your mom's buried here.
You know I ca n't leave my little girl.
Yeah, I see them.
Emmett, you go inside.
I want my boy, John.
I knew you'd come for me, Pa.
I'll deal with you later.
Yeah, that's Lonergan, boss.
I want that man.
I ai n't going to Santa Fe.
You give him to me now or I'm gonna take him.
What about me, Pa?
I said, shut up, boy!
They're coming back!
They're coming around again.
I can get us free.
Just give me your hand.
I got you, son.
Come on, get up, boss.
Come on, we got to get out of here.
Come on out of there!
I ca n't, Pa.
What is that thing?
Why are you asking me?
Because you shot it!
What do you mean, you do n't know?
They took my wife.
Is anyone in there?
Is my wife in there?
What are you talking about?
I'm not talking about anything.
What the hell are you talking about?
You got to calm down, Doc.
You're scaring the boy.
You're telling me a bunch of demons took my wife.
I did n't say any such thing.
Get a hold of yourself.
You're telling me to calm down!
It went this way.
I do n't know what it is, but it's bleeding.
That's the same direction those machines went with our kin.
Round up the horses, get some supplies!
We set off at first light!
I need that weapon.
It's the only thing that counts.
And I figure you owe me.
But Moses was unsure, so he sent his spies into that land to survey it.
And they came back with terrible stories.
Stories of evil beings, monsters the likes of which they had never seen before.
"And they were as grasshoppers in their eyes," they said.
And the people of Israel became afraid.
"How can we survive against them?"
They lost their faith.
They forgot that there is nothing to fear under heaven and earth as long as we walk in the path of righteousness.
That He created man by blowing His breath into the mud, and so there is in each of us a little breath of God.
See if you can stop the bleeding.
"Thou shalt not be afraid of the terrors of the night,
"nor the arrow that flieth by day,
"nor the pestilence that walketh in darkness."
God is testing us, friends.
He's testing our faith.
So we're going after our kin.
You come clean right now, or I'll kill you.
They took my people, too.
I've been looking for them a long time.
I know you can help me find them.
You stay away from me.
I can help you!
You know, some of these boys think they might already all be dead, boss.
If they wanted'em dead, they'd be dead.
They was roping 'people.
That was a round - up.
You're dead weight.
They took my wife, I'm comin '.
Besides, I'm a doctor.
You stop right there.
I'm sorry, son, you ca n't go.
I'll watch him on the ride.
He can water the horses.
He ai n't got nobody.
It's heading north.
It s tracks are still fresh.
Got a kid and a dog, why not a woman?
You have to take it back.
That's blood money.
Well, I goddamned earned it.
By robbing and killing.
That's gonna get us what we need!
I do n't even know why we're doing this.
You know they're all dead.
Well, I think if they wanted to kill them, I think they would have.
Only if the boss is right and they was roping them.
Bet it's to eat them.
If it was me, I'd start with your wife.
You gonna be like this the whole trip?
Cause if you are, we ai n't gonna have too many long conversations, are we?
Why do n't you sing a song or something?
Take some friendly advice?
Get yourself a gun and learn how to use it.
Look who's back.
I see you, but I do n't see my gold.
Let's say we find those people first, and then you can take your best shot at collecting.
Maybe that reward on your head would be a more attractive proposition.
Or I could just shoot you in the chest and cut that thing off your arm.
Ca n't we just be happy the guy with the big gun's back?
Much obliged to you, Mr. Lonergan.
I ai n't done nothing yet.
The tracks are washed away.
I do n't know much about boats, but I'd say that one's upside - down.
We're 500 miles from any river big enough to hold it.
I'm not going anywhere near that thing.
Sleep in the rain.
How you gentlemen doin '?
Thank you, Deputy.
You want a seat, preacher?
You know, Doc, this here is a Spencer 56 - 50.
You ever shot one of these?
No time like the present.
It's a heavy gun, yeah.
I swear to God, it's raining harder in here than it is outside.
I'm soaked through.
What in the hell are we sitting around here for?
We need to be five miles and a long trot heading 'in the opposite direction of those things.
If we tried that, the old man would shoot us himself.
Ai n't that right, Wes?
Yeah, he would.
You fixing 'to say something?
Maybe we should have called in the Army?
I ai n't gonna turn this over to no West Pointers who got to get on the telegraph to ask Washington which hand to wipe with.
I waited around at Antietam for'em to tell me what to do.
I remember those stories.
I'd listen when you'd tell them to Percy.
Them stories were n't for you.
They were for my son.
Go look after the horses.
You've been looking at this knife.
You like this knife?
You look after that.
Just align your sights, and when that target peeks up over the top, just squeeze the trigger.
Do n't yank on it, it's not your pecker.
You're holding onto this thing like you're hanging from it.
What the hell am I doing?
It's my fault she got took.
I never should have taken her to that town.
You'll get her back.
You're setting things right.
Just got to have faith.
God's been real swell to me.
I do n't mean no disrespect, preacher, but either he ai n't up there, or he do n't like me very much.
Surely you do n't expect the Lord to do everything for you, do you, Doc?
You got to earn His presence.
Then you got to recognize it, and then you have to act on it.
Now, keep your eye on the target.
There something you need?
She's the only one who knows who I am.
No, you know who you are.
You just have to remember.
I ai n't getting 'paid enough to chase Dolarhyde's idiot son halfway across the country.
Get away from that boy!
You got to go get our people back.
God do n't care who you were, son.
Come on, boy!
It's headed north.
I ca n't find the dog.
We ai n't waiting for him.
He's run off or dead.
Are n't we gonna say some words over him?
Only one who knows what to say is in the ground.
Ai n't it enough we took the time to put him there?
No, it's not enough.
If there is such a thing as a soul this man had a good one.
World was a better place for having him.
What are you all choked up about?
I'm worried about my grandpa.
When I was only just a little bit older than you are now all this was Mexico.
Word come that the Apaches was riding towards a settlement called Arivaca.
My father wanted me to be a man, so he made me ride out with the garrison, banging on a drum.
Boy, was I scared.
Well, we got there, it was too late.
They were all dead and the place was all burnt down.
This one settler fella came crawling out of a burning cabin.
He knew he was gonna die.
He rolled over, looked up into my eyes,
and he said, "Kill me."
I took this knife off his belt and I slit his throat.
The tracks are closer together.
He's slowing down, headed to that can yon.
That means you, too, pretty lady.
This is what they call a hold - up.
Boss, is that you?
What the hell are you doing here?
Is this your new gang, Jake?
I never thought I'd see you again, Jake.
You were always my favorite.
Did you break my tooth?
Would you shut up?
How many boys we got left?
It's time to set things straight.
Lay off that whiskey!
Coach is on its way, and we best damn be sober for it.
How much dynamite we get?
You got some balls riding back in here like nothing ever happened.
Boys are n't going anywhere with you, Jake.
We're fixing to rob us a coach.
And that's exactly what we're gonna do.
You watch your mouth.
I run this outfit now.
If he so much as twitches, blow her brains out of her ear.
You ai n't in no position to make threats, boyo.
Hunt, take his gun.
Where's our gold, Jake?
Well, I do remember you telling us you was leaving us high and dry because of some woman.
I guess you just left out the part about taking all our gold from that last job, huh?
So I'm gonna ask you one last time.
Where is it, Jake?
Demons took your gold.
When you get to hell you can ask for it back.
I told you not to call her that.
I said drop'em!
Not fun, is it?
You know, that was n't very nice.
Do n't forget your gun.
You'll always be my favorite.
I do n't want to do that again.
Hey, you stay with me.
You remember now, do n't you?
All I know is I owe it to her to find her.
It's not far now.
You and me, we're gonna be just fine.
Give her to me, Nat.
Give it to her.
She's gone, pal.
No, she's not gone.
The last of his people.
There's no reasoning with them.
We're all gonna die anyway.
This is what's left of the Chiricahuas.
He's saying the white people, they brought all this evil to his people.
You're the evil one!
He's saying we brought the monsters.
We did n't bring the monsters.
Tell him they took our people, too!
There's no reasoning with them!
Tell him what I said, Nat!
I'm sorry, but I could n't tell you.
Are you one of them?
I'm from a different place.
I took this form so I could walk among you.
I did n't know if I could heal this body, if I would wake up.
He wants to know where you're from.
What'd she say?
She says she came from a place above the stars.
He says you should n't talk.
What do you mean I should n't talk?
You're a guest of the chief.
Now I'm a guest?
I thought I was a prisoner!
You're both big men!
Can we listen to the woman tell her story?
Or whatever she is?
What are they doing here?
Well, that's just ridiculous.
What are they gonna do, buy something?
It's as rare to them as it is to you.
What about my grandpa?
What about my wife?
What about the other people?
Are they still alive?
If they are, they wo n't be for long.
If we let them leave, they'll come back with more and there will be no survivors.
That's what they did to my people.
I came here to make sure it would not happen again, but we have to work together.
He says his people will join her.
What's she going to do?
We can find them.
He knows where they are.
I ca n't remember anything.
I could n't even remember my own name.
He says they will take care of that.
I brought the gold.
That's why she died.
How did they build something like that?
They arrived in it.
It's their vessel.
That's only the top.
The rest is underground.
It's how they mine for gold.
So there is gold here.
Can they see out of there?
They do n't see well in daylight.
They stay underground in caverns where it's dark.
We'll never even get close.
Those flying machines will just pick us off before we get anywhere near it.
There is another way in.
The way I came out.
We got to get those creatures out of there and out in the open, where we can get at them.
So you can go in with that arm gun, get our people out.
We have one advantage, they underestimate you.
You're like insects to them.
They're not planning on defending themselves, so they'll be vulnerable.
We have n't got enough men.
This ai n't gonna work.
He says he wants to use your spyglass.
The Apaches are mountain warriors.
He says it's better to fight from high ground.
Tell him he's a fool.
There is no high ground while they got those flying machines.
How much gold we had left?
It's about $1 ,000.
I run this gang now.
Now, you might be in charge, but some of that gold's mine, fair.
After what we saw yesterday, I'm gonna need every little bit of it I can to get as far away from here as I can.
The gold goes where I go.
I got'em, Bull.
You ai n't going anywhere.
You planning a trip?
We're going as far away as we can go.
You remember la playa in Puerto Vallarta?
They got good fishing.
It's not far enough.
What the hell were those things, Jake?
They're gonna find us and they're gonna wipe us out.
What I'm saying is you got a choice.
You can drink your last few hours away on a beach, which by the way, is not a bad idea
or you can follow me one last time.
Why the hell would we do that?
Same reason you always have, Bull.
I'll make you rich.
Listen to me, damn it!
He does n't understand tactics.
You got to explain to him.
Look, we ca n't just run around hollering and throwing spears and shooting arrows at the damn thing.
We got to draw them out of there onto open ground where we can surround them, attack them on all sides.
He said he's not going to let you lead his people.
He's saying they need to open their hearts and see in you what he has seen.
That his parents died in the Mexican War and you took him in when he was only a boy.
Taught him how to take care of himself even though you were not blood.
That you despise battle but would never run from it.
That you're a fierce warrior worthy of any fight.
He says if you're such a great warrior, why do you only have a man and a boy to follow you into battle?
You should n't be here.
A lady, a wife?
My wife, you know, she's a Mexicano.
I'm not gonna be here very long.
None of us are here very long.
Do n't ever do that to me again.
I do n't know what we're going to do.
Demons are coming out.
Go up where I showed you.
You see our people, wave your arms.
If your people are in there, I'll get them out.
This is how they get the gold out.
How bad is it, Doc?
Compadre, you'll be all right.
Maybe not point the gun at me.
Put some weight and see how it feels.
They're not going down!
Keep at it till we get our people out!
Doc, get down here!
I always dreamed of riding into battle with you.
I always dreamed of having a son like you.
Do n't look into the light.
I told you not to look into the light.
Each one's different.
You'd better hurry.
There's more of them coming!
I came here to destroy that thing.
Wait, I ca n't take it off.
You can control it.
Same way you shoot it.
You have to stop thinking.
If I can get it to its core, I can stop them.
Good - bye, Jake.
They're coming out the other side!
What about Jake and Ella?
You all right, old man?
She's still inside.
You're all grown up.
Do n't you remember me, boy?
I do n't remember much.
I thought you were dead.
How many more songs we gotta listen to before we get another drink?
Hey, simmer down there, cowboy!
One more shot of whiskey right here.
What do you got there?
This ai n't Wells Fargo.
I need some coin.
Doc, a drink for me and my friend here.
Ai n't he a little young?
What, after what he's been through, Doc?
Two sarsaparillas, please!
And this should take care of any outstanding debt.
Yes, comin', Pa.
Next round's on the Dolarhydes.
All this gold's gonna make things different.
We're gonna have a railroad in here soon.
That'll change the cattle business.
Run these ledgers back to the bank for me, will you?
Tell them I need some new checks.
I want the new ones to read "Dolarhyde and Son."
That sound good to you?
You were n't gonna leave without saying good - bye, were you?
I'm a wanted man.
I could have sworn I saw Jake Lonergan die in those caves, did n't you, Sheriff?
I was looking forward to hanging him myself.
I could use a good man around here.
She's in a better place.
I'll see you around, Colonel.
- What are you talking about?
Areyousure youwantto do this?
The signal will be better outside.
- Hands in the air!
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
You have the right to an attorney.
Hello, usman. Ican helpyou.
And I do n' thaveany friends.
Can I get in there?
I have this room at 4:00!
I know you do n't get a lot of news downstairs, zamparo, but we just broke up a massive terrorist plot, all right?
We've got hours of him talking about waging jihad and killing children.
Right, but talking, though, sir, not... he's not doing anything.
Is n't that the point?
Hey, Tim. How's it going?
You celebrating something, Nate?
You seeing someone special, huh?
Genius, emergency meeting in the conference room!
The crash was off 301 around 2:00 last night.
Local police controlled the scene, so, thankfully, the press knows nothing.
These containers carried cesium - 137.
It's used for radiotherapy applications in hospitals, but it's highly regulated and had no business being on that truck.
When we tracked the shipment back to Baltimore, the customs record showed eight containers, not two.
So there's six more of them out there, all of them in the country illegally.
If that quantity made it's way into a radiological device, we could be looking at thousands of casualties, mass evacuations and radioactive contamination throughout the D.C. area.
Uh, lab analysis puts the cesium coming from north Africa.
So the guys on four, they put together this map.
It's an analysis of Muslim communities in DC, Maryland and Virginia, along with their countries of origin.
We'd like each -- yes?
What about leads on the dt front?
Well, given the cesium came from north Africa, we do n't think domestic is really in the picture.
The last time anyone tried to build a dirty bomb on us soil was James cummings.
He was a white supremacist living in Maine, he was going to set it off at Obama's inauguration.
He had uranium, thorium, and he was trying to acquire cesium.
I'm sure you're familiar with the case.
It goes without saying, anyone here is welcome to pursue any leads they think are fruitful.
- I'm Angela zamparo.
You got a couple minutes?
Nicorette just is n't the same.
You seem like you've got a bit more going on than most around here.
You remember Oklahoma city?
Well, yeah, i guess I was five, but sure.
What do you know about Timothy McVeigh?
Ah... he was some kind of lone extremist in a militia?
Do n't be an asshole who bullshits questions you do n't know the answer to.
Timothy McVeigh was a decorated Gulf war veteran.
He was a white supremacist, following a plan.
- A plan from a book called the Turner diaries.
It's about a "race war" to exterminate blacks, Jews, and "mud people."
You know how the war gets started?
The hero drives a truck bomb into a federal building.
Timothy McVeigh was reenacting that scene from the Turner diaries.
He was carrying the book with him when he was arrested.
What he was trying to do was start the race war.
You're focused on the islamic guys. I get it.
We all create a narrative based on what we think is important.
We see what we want to see.
But just because you're not looking at something does n't mean it's not there.
So, why are you telling me this?
I'm talking about a blood andguts, in thestreet, killorbe killedracewar.
He gets 20,000 listeners a night.
We believe he's based just outside of DC, but almost nobody knows him personally.
But I have an informant, a skinhead in a gang.
And the leader of that gang is friends with wolf.
So I need someone to get in there, and get close to him.
Right and I'm trying to tell you that this is not my thing!
I barely passed the pft!
What do you think undercover work is?
Beating guys up and shooting at them?
No, it's people skills. It's controlling situations.
This is the only undercover training you'll ever need.
I saw you with that Muslim kid. You got most of this going on anyway.
High IQ, great people skills, but not your typical FBI profile.
Introverted, an outsider, unhappy childhood.
Fine, but I'm trying to tell you, I do n't have the skills for this!
I ca n't even defend myself!
You do have the skills, and they mean you will never have to!
What did you say to that kid?
"You want to change things, so nobody has to suffer the way you did."
Now some of these things havea half - life of 30 years.
Do you know how management looks at undercover, Nate?
You think this office is bad?
I just want to discuss the option, sir.
Of what, of killing your whole career?
They slit your throat, and they pull your tongue right out through it?
Oh, what, so you want him to go in blind, so he has no idea what he's getting into?
You're just trying to manipulate him!
And you're not?
But you better think long and hard about this.
Larry Ford, developing typhoid and cholera.
I could go on like this for hours.
I was in the marines for three years, on a wmd squad in Iraq.
But I saw a lot of things over there that changed me.
And I'm starting to wonder...
But I wantto be oneofthem.
And I want to make a difference.
Okay. Not bad. What else?
If you get yourself in a situation where you have to show somebody your dd - 214, then you're already done.
Good. Now what else?
So what do they want from you?
I'm loyal, I'm dedicated to the the cause.
No. Any thug can be loyal.
What the guys with the cesium... are gonna want?
Welcome to medvale medical supply company.
My military contacts helped me start this business.
Most of our sales are online.
Our radiotherapy products are specifically designed for the handling and storing of radioactive material.
So we can acquire sensitive materials and hide them.
He's in a gang called the panzer strikeforce, and the leader of the gang is this guy.
He's friends with Dallas wolf.
So Vince and Dallas wolf are tight?
Yeah, I told you, Vince calls into wolf's show every week.
Yougetcloseto Vince. Then, youusehim togetto knowwolf.
This is my friend Nate i was telling you about.
All right, spread'em.
Roy does our security.
Hey, are you a cop?
Sorry about that, Nate.
But you know how it is.
- Yeah, absolutely.
- Whoa, whoa.
Frank tells me you were in Iraq.
Uh, yeah, three years in the corps.
- You kill anybody?
He's Johnny. He's a fresh cut.
We're trying to teach him the ropes.
I do n't talk about that.
But what I did see was a lot of our guys go down.
So then I get home, i started listening to Dallas wolf.
Dallas and I go way back.
He's somebody who's telling the truth.
He's out there, he's asking why were we there?
And the answer's always the same.
Iraq, 9 /11, osama bin laden, what does it all come back to?
How many white men slaughtered their brothers in world war ii?
Who's always pulling the strings?
It's all here in front of us.
But most people are blind.
Look at this bottle.
You see anything funny?
You're talking about the Jew tax?
Tell'em, Nate.
Start looking at the food you buy, and you'll see this little "u."
The union of orthodox rabbis gets paid to perform a "blessing" on everything in the grocery store.
For this "blessing," they rake in billions of dollars in taxes.
We ca n't control the ketchup, but we can control the streets.
That's how it went down in Germany.
And we think of ourselves as a sturm abteilung.
We are a thinking man's soldiers.
And that is where the revolution starts.
We're not these tired old kkk guys, waiting for some catastrophe to start a race war.
- We're the catastrophe.
And we need guys like you, with military backgrounds.
Well, always room to improve, though, right?
Well, like, look at the position of this booth and then tell me, without looking, where the nearest exits are.
- The point is, of all the large booths in this restaurant, you picked the one farthest from the exits.
No, we're ready for whatever goes down.
Yeah, with only you and him, i do n't know your name yet, I'm sorry, carrying?
When you pat someone down so they're facing everybody's lap, it's pretty easy to tell.
You spend three years in Iraq, you learn how to scan a room.
Now I only got one question for you.
Why are you wearing levis?
Yeah, no, sorry, i just could n't help notice when I was patting 'you down.
While you were doing your little detective work all up in everybody's lap.
So why are you wearing them?
Because when i got home from Iraq, my brother gave me these jeans... as a homecoming gift.
Now, does he understand the struggle we're in?
You wanna boycott the Jews?
You ever look at the fortune 500?
Frank tells me you run a medical supply company now?
Yeah, my military contacts helped me set up.
I'd love to talk to you about that sometime.
You know, when I was 13, i actually played soccer.
One day, I came into the locker room, right?
His head was up against the toilet, and his face was just covered,
I mean, covered in blood, like flaps of skin.
I'd never seen anyone get beaten like that.
And when I came in, they just stared at me.
They stared, and I...
And just left him.
Yeah, when I was your age, i got pushed around a lot.
But you can use that.
I learned to be proud.
Is n't that right, Johnny?
All right, so what, are we gonna stand around all night
Hey, Nate, you know what, man?
Is n'tthatright, Johnny?
You did n't hear me?
Yeah, come on in.
It's a mess, sorry.
Yeah, but it kind of looks like you just moved in.
So, what are you guys doing here?
Aw, do n't break my heart.
What are we doing here?
Come on, do n't make it sound like you're not happy to see me.
See Vince is outside. He's got a little surprise for you.
Cool, well, I'm good to go.
- Let's go, Roy.
- What's the rush?
- All right, you ready?
Yeah, I know, I'llget toit.
You make him look small, you make him into an enemy.
Sometimes, Angela, it would just be great to hear, "good job."
I'm only so hard on you because I'm trying to protect you.
You have to remember your objective here.
So what do I do about that?
Try relating to these guys as human beings. You know?
Open up to them, if you can.
You may have more in common with them than you think.
Hey, that looks good on you, man.
Um, just go in, I got another shirt in the cargo.
Hi, you must be Vince's friend Nate!
- I'm Becky, Gerry's wife.
- Such a pleasure to have you.
- Thank you for having me.
Hey, Nate, i made some cupcakes.
The frosting is a little messed up, but they taste good.
Come check this out.
John, canwe getthe graphic?
They'rebusingin hundreds of protestors from the DC area.
Because while we come in peace, we'recertainly notafraidof war.
God, that's the first I'm hearing about this rally.
I mean, god knows you ca n't get any real news on the yidivision, but still...
Are you planning on going, Nathan?
And this is Andrew Blackwell from the Aryan alliance.
- Hail victory, brother.
The Aryan alliance, huh?
I've read a lot about you guys.
Well, we're the premiere white nationalist group in the world, so that's not surprising.
Earnest walton, grand dragon, good to meet you.
Earnest is with the local klan.
Yeah, you should stop by one of our meetings.
You should check out our website, too.
We're always looking for quality people.
Ah, I do n't think Nate's into all that religious stuff.
I just think Nate is a little more rational than that.
Come on, Nate. Let's go back and get some food.
Stay away from those faggots.
Jews invented the printing press, and the Bible is the most published book in the world.
I mean, anything seem off to you?
How about the fact the romans conquered every mud race on earth, and then christianity finished them off in a hundred years?
You gotta know who to stick with in this movement.
You're with us.
- It's two hours, be good.
Gerry, there's somebody I want you to meet. This is Nate.
- Hey, Gerry Conway.
- Nate Thomas, nice to meet you.
Vince told me all about you.
Make yourself at home. I am throwing on some veggie burgers.
- Hey, hey, I'm Nate.
- Madeline. Nice to meet you.
- Hey, Madeline.
- This is Timmy.
- Hey, Timmy.
You want to come see our tree house?
Uh, yeah, sure, where are we going?
Oh, right, yeah, there.
Oh, wow, that is great!
Did your dad build this?
- I built it!
- You built this?
- But my daddy helped.
- It's to protect us.
- Yeah, from what?
If the mud people come.
Always be ready. Always be watchful and stick together.
You guys kidnapping my guest?
This is amazing, man.
Well, I've always been good with my hands.
You know how you spell love, Nate?
Ninety percent of the time you'll ever spend with your kids
- comes before the age of 12. - Wow.
You been in the movement long, Nate?
Um, not long. Just since i got back from Iraq.
Yeah, Vince told me you served. - Mm-hm.
Um, what about you?
You seem to know a lot of people in this movement.
Ah, they probably come for the free food.
Yeah, as much as I can, yes, you know, I try to create a positive environment for everybody in the community, and a place for us to come together and be healthy in body and spirit.
It makes me so sad to see those two.
They gotta clean up their act.
Well, how do you mean?
Well, the cigarettes, and alcohol, the language.
To be honest, now that I met you, I'm kind of surprised you invited those guys.
Well, you ca n't exclude them.
I mean, they're the next generation.
Need to understand their heritage, and be proud of it.
What kind of a world will they grow up in?
No, no, man, we're gonna teach these two a lesson.
We're Aryan warriors, right?
Hey, you two!
Hold on, what did you say?
They get the point.
You thought you were a big man, huh?
He gets it, Roy!
I thought you were a big man.
- Come on, let's go!
Yeah, I think they got the message, Roy!
Man, those two were mine!
That was n't an accident, was it?
Was it, Nate?
You wanted them to get away.
Okay, you're goddamn right i wanted them to get away!
You think about security cameras, Roy?
You think about the liquor store we were just in?
Anaccountant, aschool teacher, a lawyer, fireman, he'sanengineer, not a criminal record in sight, butAndrewBlackwell, he's a differentstory.
Uh, he said he was going to wolf's rally.
He's the national director of the Aryan alliance.
They're based in Ohio, he would n't just come all this way to be in a rally.
Wait, if wolf is involved in this, he ca n't be doing it alone, right?
I mean, he'd need help, and organization.
Exactly, so you need to figure out how wolf and Blackwell are connected, and why he's really here.
Vince, good to see you.
Rich, can we get some literature, please?
Can everyone take a seat?
If you take millions of white people, and flood every country in Africa with them, what do they call that?
But what's happening to every white country on earth?
You've got affirmative action that kills white jobs.
Abortion, that kills white babies.
Gay rights, that kill white families.
Folks, let me explain something to you.
"Diversity" is a code word. And what it means is white genocide!
This is not the order that we agreed to.
Now just a second, Andrew.
You know, we're at this rally every year, and we start with the colonial patriots.
Well, this is n't "every year," is it?
To be fair, Harris, maybe we should.
Vince, can you introduce me to Dallas?
You're the "invisible white knights" of the ku klux klan!
I want to introduce you to my good friend, this is Nate Thomas.
- Uh, Mr. wolf?
- Yes, what is it?
I did n't want to get into this in front of Vince, but I'd like to talk to you about an investment.
I represent a few people who are big fans of yours, and they want to help.
- Is that so?
- Yes, sir.
They have a number of assets in the online media space, and they feel the potential for your show is being limited by your advertising budget.
They want to help you penetrate some new markets, and they see no reason why you ca n't go nationwide.
Well, that is great, son.
Here, call this number and we'll talk.
Okay, great. That sounds great, Mr. wolf.
- Call me, Dallas.
We're here today because we're proud of our race!
We love our race!
And we're here to say that.
The white race is under attack in this country.
But nobody seems to give a damn!
Where's Jesse Jackson to fight for white rights!
If you're white, and you are standing over there...
... you're on the wrong side of that barricade!
Wake up, white people!
It's morning in America and there's a new day coming.
What are you doing, man?
Come join your race!
Come join the white race!
- I gotta help him.
Get your hands off of me!
Andrew, can you walk?
I brought you some chamomile tea. It'll help you relax.
There's our wounded warrior.
How you feeling, buddy?
Yeah, much better.
Ah, no problem.
I'm gonna put some music on.
I brought you Sammy to keep you company.
I... I love brahms.
See, Becky, i knew he was quality.
I think the fourth is my favorite.
Yeah, mine, too.
Except maybe the -- the first?
Now listen, if you like brahms, I've got this clarinet quintet that will blow your mind.
They're dead, Gerry.
That's why I avoid the political stuff.
Besides, I've heard it can be dangerous.
I thought you guys were vegetarians.
What's "vices"?
Oh, boy, there we go!
I'm sorry about that, that's my ride.
Gerry, Becky, thanks for everything.
Nathan, I do n't know what to say.
I owe you, big time.
Why do n't you stop by the compound some time.
Got ta go with Bernstein.
Listen, I ca n't help it, he's a great conductor.
Jews listen to Wagner, do n't they?
So, Gerry, if you do n't mind my asking, how did you end up in the movement?
Listen, for me, it was the books.
My parents were practically liberals.
It all started with this.
Read it in four days.
It explains race, culture, capitalism and how democracy destroyed western civilization.
"Three people form a government. Then two of them vote to steal the wealth of the third."
- You can bring it back.
- Oh, no, I could n't.
Nate, Nate, please.
But that was it?
I mean, it was just books woke you up?
Well, you know, i had my theories.
And then a three - month engineering contract opened up in Kenya.
I was young, i wanted to see the world.
And, uh, Nate, listen,
I got no problem with them having their own country, everybody should.
But if you go there, and you see, they were n't even living like animals.
You know, animals do n't live in their own feces, do they?
So, if you ever have any doubt white men created civilization, just go have a look.
So, howwasthe brahms?
"Openupto them?" You said.
He was grabbing my ass, the whole thing.
And he kept insisting i go to this club with him, where I knew he was gonna make his big move, but if I did n't go, then, you know, I could blow my whole cover.
So we're at a bar, and I tell him I want oysters.
So I get a dozen, i start plowing through them.
Then I start acting queasy.
I run to the bathroom, stick my finger down my throat.
So now there's puke all over my dress,
I tell him I got sick off the oysters and take a cab home.
Two days later, he was arrested.
But there was the thrill, you know?
Yeah, so why'd you stop?
It was just it's no way to live, the paranoia, the tension.
And I wanted to spend more time with my kids.
You do n't think I'm mommy material?
No, no... no.
Yeah, I got two princesses.
Perfect, little suburban life.
But the case wo n't go forever.
You ca n't change the way people think, but you are making a difference.
Nathan, good to see you.
Can we get you anything, coffee?
Oh, no, I'm good, thanks.
This is a great set - up you got here.
All right, let's give you the tour.
This parcel is actually pretty small, but we're purchasing the one next to it.
How are you handling that?
Well, we tell them we're here to stay.
Make no mistake about it. We show up at their homes, their businesses, their churches.
So you're moving the national headquarters?
No, we're keeping the compound in Ohio, it's just with everything going on right now, we needed a stronger presence here.
- Is that your firing range?
- Yeah, come on.
I'm no marksman, by any means, but I have some expertise in range design, just from training the Iraqi police.
What's your danger area template?
To contain your cone of fire.
I mean, how do you control your overshoot?
We have n't gotten to that yet.
Maybe if you have time,
- you could talk to the guys about it.
I need to see what kind of equipment you've got, but I'm happy to.
Uh, come on up here.
- Are those cots?
We'll be able to sleep 200 in there.
You see the type of organization we have here, but we could always use a man like you, Nathan.
Educated, war veteran, clean record.
Yeah, we have our contacts in law enforcement, local, state, federal, not to mention military hospitals, laboratories, you name it.
And so what's the overall objective here?
I mean, are you just trying to get the message out, or what?
What would we do with them?
They're at home sitting on their asses, - watching sitcoms and surfing Facebook.
This is revolutionary activity we're talking about here.
Look, I'm flattered by the interest, but, you know, I've been around the movement awhile now and a lot of these guys are all talk.
Now for me to really want to get involved, I need to know there's bigger things going on here.
Yeah... none taken.
This is the entire DC water system.
Plants, pipelines, the whole deal.
Now, Nathan, the guys you're hanging out with, they're all talk, because they're punks.
We got no use for them.
We need men like you.
I'm looking for Dallas wolf, but I must have the wrong house.
Oh, no, he's here.
The studio's back here.
I'm moving studios right now, so this is all temporary.
Thanks for taking the time to see me, Dallas.
I just spent the afternoon with Andrew at the Aryan alliance.
They have an incredible organization.
Yeah, they seem really serious about the struggle.
About doing whatever it takes.
They're true patriots, those guys.
Well, let me give you a bit of background on me.
I was in Iraq for three years, on a wmd squad.
And then when I got back, my military contacts helped me set up a medical supply company.
Wow, this is great.
Yeah, we do it all, from bandages and syringes to X-ray and radiotherapy equipment.
And with the highly regulated stuff, we can cut through a lot of the red tape and deal directly, and discreetly.
Yes, I've got an investor lined up who's very excited about expanding your reach.
That's exactly what I need.
So how do I meet him?
But he'd love for you to put together a proposal about how you'd expand the show.
Funny you should mention that.
I've been trying to raise $7,500 to break into the Florida market.
They're ripe right now, with all the immigration stuff.
So for him to move forward, he needs to know you're serious about this.
Nate, I've been ready to give my life for this cause for 20 years now.
What I need is the right people behind me.
So you tell your investor that if he wants action, he's got the right guy.
The whole case is about to blow wide open!
He's in with Wolf, he's in with the Aryan alliance.
Let me get this straight. So after everything we spent on your cover, even after the medical supply business, you want me to ask for $7,500 as an "investment" in this guy's radio show?
Oh, yeah, I'm just flush with cash!
Sir, the alliance is building a compound outside DC.
Wolf's house is setting off a geiger counter!
I spent six hours last night reading your transcripts,
Look at how much carbon is built up on this bolt.
When's the last time you cleaned this?
I've been meaning to get to most of them.
Okay, guys, seriously!
We need to go through the whole inventory.
Andrew's waiting on this.
I'm gonna have to tell Andrew, the only way it's gonna change is with new policies.
You get on the phone yourself!
Call them up and ask them...
It's been a while.
Yeah, you kinda disappeared on us.
I'm sorry about that, Vince.
Yeah, I bet you have.
Thanks for stopping by.
Be seeing you, Nate.
What was that all about?
Roy says the police have been following him.
Have you seen how that guy behaves?
It's a miracle he's not in jail already.
Sure, what's up?
I'm throwing a youth event for Hitler's birthday.
There's a campground a couple miles from here.
- Help us scout it.
It's amazing how much land there is right outside DC.
Let me ask you something, Nathan.
What's your opinion on infiltration?
How do we prevent it?
Well, it's tough.
For one thing, you gotta keep guys with rap sheets out of important positions.
Maybe we should make everybody take it.
I mean, i think someone who's trained can beat a polygraph without blinking.
Yeah, I mean, for informants, that might work.
Do you suspect someone?
You know, it's like they say at these rallies.
You look to the left, look to the right, one of these people is a snitch.
Turn left right up here.
You okay there, Nate?
You look a little off?
Just, uh, tired...
Been a long day.
Well, I think this is a great location.
Yeah, I like it.
We tell them we're a Christian organization, holding a youth event.
I gotta ask you something.
Said there's no record of you having served in the marines.
I was on a wmd squad, so that's black ops.
Wait, hold on, are you guys taking this seriously?
What if he was n't convinced? What if he calls wolf?
You do n't know if he was convinced!
You do n't even know if they talk, okay?
You're being -- yeah, I'd like $7,500 in cash.
You're a man of your word, which is a rare thing in this movement.
So, listen, Dallas, my investor is very excited, but he wants to know some more about what you're planning, some details.
Oh, okay, I think it was all in the presentation, but we start with online in tampa, and then we move down the - no, no, I mean, beyond that.
Beyond the show, like what we talked about.
The actions we're gonna take.
I'm sorry, Nate. I lost you.
Bigger than Oklahoma city, bigger than 9 /11 -- oh, yeah, for sure.
Which is why expanding the show is so important.
He told me you'd been working together.
Well, yeah, sure, i mean, he came to the rally.
No, no, what my investor needs to know is what are the concrete steps that you are taking to start the race war.
As I said to you before, I have the expertise, the connections, the tools.
Maybe there's some kind of misunderstanding.
I thought we were talking about expanding the show.
Yeah, which my investor is happy to do, but if you're not willing to be honest about the other actions you're taking, then he's not gonna be able to support you.
Okay, Nate, fair enough.
Sorry it did n't work out.
I saw the plans, Dallas, for the water system.
Andrew showed them to me, okay?
So, I know all about it, and now I just need you to stop pretending and be honest with me.
This is private property.
You're no longer welcome here.
I'm asking you to leave.
I'm on your side.
I did n't know you'd be here.
Has anyone talked to him?
No, it's your show.
So, Dallas. Or should I call you Randy?
That is your real name.
You can call me whatever you like, agent Zamparo.
Any reason you're using an assumed name?
I'm a public entertainer.
I'm here because of the guy I called about.
He shows up at my conference, talking about investing in my show.
Did he give you money?
That's a lot.
- Why would he do that?
- Because he's a wacko!
No, agent Zamparo, I do n't.
I have information about a truck accident outside DC last night, involving classified radio active material, but now the FBI is trying to cover it all up.
You've gotta be kidding me.
It's a radio show.
So you think it's entertaining to predict and incite terrorist attacks?
Why do n't you talk to somebody around here who knows something about the law, preferably a man!
Brandenburg vs Ohio, 1969, it is not illegal to advocate violence.
The first amendment does n't protect people who have knowledge of an actual crime!
What knowledge of a crime do I have?
Well, why do n't you tell me, Randy?
What is this accident?
What is this FBI cover - up?
Why are you living at an unregistered address?
And why is that location lighting up a geiger counter?
You've been following me?
You've been casing my house?
Why do n't you answer my questions?
So what is the zog covering up? "
As for the unregistered address, I live with my mom, and I'd like to keep that private, if it's okay with you?
I'm an entertainer. I do this for money, and for fun.
Can you open the door, please?
I warned you, I tried to tell you.
- We still might have a weapons case!
- We ran those serial numbers.
Every single one of those guns is legally registered.
Okay, so you think there's nothing to any of this?
The barracks for 200 guys?
- The water system plans?
It's all talk! He keeps those plans around to trot out when he wants to act like a big shot!
What are they gonna do, they're gonna put radioactive material in the water supply?
You know, we see what we want to see!
This happens sometimes, you know?
- I mean, it sucks, but
It's the nature of the work.
This... this happened because of your pet theory!
And like an idiot, i we nt along with it!
"Oh, yeah, she's an expert," i thought.
"She knows what she's doing!"
This has been great for you!
You got the thrill back! You got the excitement you've been wanting, you got an escape from your little suburban life,
- by manipulating me!
- No, that is not fair!
I thought we had a case!
God, do you even know how many dead ends I've been down?
You knew I was so eager, so desperate to do something meaningful, to actually work on a real case in this place, that I would do anything you wanted, while you just sat back and enjoyed the ride!
Hey, good to see you!
I've been calling you!
I just wanted to return these.
Uh, that's nice of you, but I do n't think I can.
Aw, come on, just for a cup of tea?
Is everything okay, Nate?
Yeah, yeah, why do you ask?
Well, you said you're headed out west.
God, it's hard to find what we're looking for in life.
But then, I listen to something like that.
We all have that power, Nate.
Honestly... I used to feel that way, Gerry.
I always felt like i could change the world.
You know, I could right wrongs, you know, fight injustice.
Nate, listen, it's guys like us that feel these things the most.
Yeah, I just keep thinking about that quote.
"For evil to triumph, it only takes good men to do nothing."
- I'm just really tired.
You know, Nate, maybe you're going about this the wrong way.
That's not how the change is gonna come.
It's gonna come from the unknown soldiers, from the leaderless resistance.
Let's go out back.
I made some improvements to the tree house.
Talking frankly is something we have to be very careful about.
You know, I've thinking about this for a long time, Nate, years really.
What's needed is an event.
An event that wakes people up.
They're sleepwalkers out there.
Think about this regime.
Media brainwashing, secret courts, mass surveillance, waco, Ruby Ridge.
That's how it all starts.
All the lies that the zionists tell about Nazi Germany, that's what's actually happening right now!
The irony of it! Right?
Because it's not the event that wakes people up, it's the reaction to the event.
Yes, you get it!
Yeah, look at the sons of Liberty.
That is how you start a revolution.
Yeah, yeah, I always felt this kinship with you, Nate.
I want to make a difference.
I still got connections from my Africa days.
Okay, and we have the means to create that kind of event.
But, Nate, if you get involved we may not live to see the world we're building.
But I'll have helped to build it.
A man's body dies, but his deeds live forever.
There's a way you can help us.
We need to talk to the s.A.C., now!
Oh, my lord, who the hell wrapped it?
Sorry abut that, just having some technical difficulties over here.
- Okay, one, two...
- Hey, Morgan, David...
I want you to meet somebody.
Morgan, good to meet you.
- Greetings, sir. I'm David.
So is the wedding out here?
Yeah, it's right over here.
Wait till we see it all lit up.
Pure of spirit and pure of race, these two souls commit themselves to the defense and prosperity of their sacred blood.
May their sons and daughters fill this land, forever honoring their duty to folk, kindred, soil, and honor.
If you trust me, you can trust him.
No one wants to sell to an anonymous buyer.
If we give up that prepaid phone crap, i use my real name, I got three guys i can get it from right now.
If we do it the morning of -- yeah, I thought we were at least trying to do this without getting caught?
Guys, guys, shh. Nate has a potential solution for us.
A smaller quantity will give you a much bigger blast.
I run a medical supply company.
And you're gonna get tatp?
I know it's not the easiest thing, but I've got some connections.
Assuming I can, what are we gonna do about the cesium powder itself?
Ready when we need it.
No, I mean, how are we going to handle it?
No... radioactive particles will pass through those as easy as anything else, including your skin.
- Well, what do you suggest?
- I think we need suits.
They'll be pretty bulky, but we only need to wear them when the powder's out in the open.
If you can get the tatp, Sunday is our day.
You guys remember Timothy McVeigh's last words?
"It matters not how strait the gait, how charged with punishments the scroll,
Are you sure this is gonna look right?
Wow. It looks great.
The secret is the smell.
Where's the bleach powder?
Yeah, that's why terrorists love TATP.
You ca n't identify it without a mass spectrometer.
Okay, if you say so.
Look, can I just say I'm sorry about what i said to you the other day.
That's what this job does to you.
Keep at it another ten years and you'll turn into a real asshole...
It's totally secure.
We can keep everything in here, and then, on game day, we can use this space to put it all together.
And here is the TATP.
- Nope. All good.
Morgan's a pharmacist.
Hm, these crystals seem a little small.
Okay, let's test it.
You got a mass spectrometer in your bag?
Hold on, what do you mean?
It burns for a while before it explodes.
I saw it on YouTube.
Do you know how dangerous this stuff is?
Hey, you are not the only one with experience!
This is a highly unstable substance, okay?
It's sensitive to heat, friction -- which is why I'll do the test carefully!
Now you want to see the video?
We are not lighting this stuff on fire!
You know how many bomb techs i saw get their faces blown off trying to deal with this stuff in Iraq?
I've worked with this company for two years!
They are not gonna send me a container full of baking soda, okay?
You want to use ammonium nitrate, fine with me!
So, can we see the suits?
You guys, what would be worse, radiation poisoning or wearing this thing around for a couple hours?
And now they're all at Gerry's.
But it's Saturday?
And why do they need ammonium nitrate?
I do n't know. Me and Hernandez are heading over to meet the surveillance team at Gerry's now.
No! You can not raid them yet!
You do n't even know if they have the cesium?
And Gerry's phone's off.
Okay, I have to go over there.
- What are you doing here?
- I was calling, you did n't answer. I got worried.
- I just told you!
I'm gonna give you one more chance.
I called three times, you did n't answer any of them!
I got worried something happened to you!
All right, put it down!
He's telling the truth!
- Yes! I was worried, so I was checking constantly!
Okay, calm down, everybody calm down.
Okay, can somebody tell me what is going on?
I sent David to do surveillance on your shop last night.
I saw an electrical crew go into the building across the street.
- In the middle of the night?
Could there be like a power problem?
No, they must have traced the TATP you ordered.
- Okay, if they're on to the shop
They're on to you.
Are you sure you were n't followed?
- If he said he was n't, he was n't!
Morgan, get back to work, please, Jesus.
We had to move forward, immediately.
And you were n't gonna let me know?
Nate, I'm sorry.
It's too risky.
Well, he's here now, let's get him to help!
What about the tatp?
David got ammonium nitrate instead.
He used his name, so the jig is up.
They'll know it's us.
It's not gonna matter tomorrow.
We're in this to the end now, Nate.
They're not gonna take us alive.
All right, let me help.
I should go wash up so I do n't contaminate anything.
Hey, Nate! How are you?
- The cesium is here!
Angela, you have to tell him to wait.
There are three guys in there with machine guns and they're building a bomb.
This is a residential neighborhood.
His wife and kids are in the house.
This is a volatile situation.
No, he does n't get it!
These guys are fanatics!
They will not be taken alive!
Tom, you're not in there!
We have to listen to him.
Okay, let's get these suits ready.
Okay, let's get ready to move!
We are almost done here!
Come on, help me!
- Come on, get your hood on!
Come on, get up!
Can you believe it?
Yeah, I'm gonna miss it here, though.
"This should have been a noble creature"
Yeah, Gerry, and all of them, really.
Yeah, that's why you were the right guy for the job.
Why do you think I picked you?
I knew that you would understand them.
And they'd understand you.
And the more authentic you became with them, the more authentic they'd become with you.
Because when it comes down to it, there really is only one essential ingredient to fascism.
I blamed those black kids, and I blamed this school, I blamed the cops;
I was gonna hurt everyone else the way they hurt me.
I look at you guys and I see myself.
But you guys do n't have to make the same mistakes I did.
You do n't have to be victims.
Thanks for coming by.
I'm so proud of you, Johnny.
You know what they say...
It all begins with the word.
Climate controlled stacks, energy efficient, now mind you the whole collection could probably fit on a Kindle, but at least the cadets will have another place to get out of the rain.
Did you have much input on the design?
I approved the blue prints.
If something's gonna have my name on it, I want to make damn sure they build it right.
I think my husband fancies himself a bit of an architect.
Well, Jefferson designed Monticello...
Luckily I do n't have any, so that particular temptation has n't presented itself.
The Sentinel, South Carolina's premiere military college.
They taught me the values of honor, duty and respect.
They also hazed me, tried to break me, and senior year, nearly expelled me when I volunteered for a Senate race and my studies suffered.
But that did n't stop them from soliciting a hefty sum for their new library 30 years later.
How quickly poor grades are forgotten in the shadow of power and wealth.
Your drink is only about half as full as it should be, Frank.
Are you trying to get me drunk?
Drunk, passed out in the gutter so I can steal your wife.
Did you get the email about the Riflemen?
From my office. About the invitations.
I was hoping they would be here.
I'll check the list, but I do n't remember any email...
In fact, here's how you can make it up to me, freshen my drink.
That I can do.
Remy, nice to see you here.
Gerry and all the folks at SanCorp give you their regards.
She's here somewhere, fending off admirers.
SanCorp was very disappointed she turned down their donation.
And they're also concerned about Peter Russo running for governor.
Now, how do you know about that?
Three - quarters of Pennsylvania sits on top of the Marcellus Shale.
If I ca n't find out who's running for governor, I do n't deserve a dime of what they're paying me.
This Watershed Bill Russo sponsors places a lot of restrictions on drilling...
Remy, Congress is in recess and this weekend is not about work.
I apologize, you are absolutely right.
But my other clients did n't pay for your library, or my plane ticket down here.
Yes, nice little junket for you.
I do hope you're taking in the sights.
This is n't my first trip to Charleston.
But I'll bet it's your first time not as my Press Secretary.
Who else you have coming in?
I did n't want to pack tonight too much.
You know, these receptions are usually just for the money people, like yourself.
But I'm gonna save that for my big speech tomorrow, and that way I'm not gonna bore y'all to tears twice.
Frank Underwood exemplifies all the virtues we try to instill in our graduates.
We're so proud to call you an alumnus, Frank, and to have your name as a permanent fixture on our campus.
Thank you, President Higgins.
I first want to thank SanCorp Industries for providing the funds to make the library possible.
When I matriculated here as a young cadet,
Jimmy Carter had just been elected President.
After I graduated, I wished that I could have had another four years, just like Jimmy.
Well, neither of us got our wish, but I left this campus with fond memories.
I got your damn email.
How long has that light been like that?
A month, maybe.
And nobody's come to fix it?
Nobody do n't fix nothing around here.
Now it's too dark.
I'm running for governor.
That's why I came up to Philly.
There's a community meeting tomorrow.
I'm gonna talk to the shipbuilders about a plan to bring their jobs back, so they support me in the election.
I do n't know nothing about that stuff.
Okay, listen, there's gonna be some stories coming out about me, in the news, about my past.
I just wanted to give you a heads up, so it does n't catch you off guard.
I do n't watch the news no more.
You want to see some pictures of Kevin and Sarah?
Too dark to look at pictures.
No, no, it's on my phone, you do n't need any light.
Get it away from me.
I hate those things.
And Gluckenheimer, what he did...
"Well, you look lovely today, Mrs. Governor."
And the thing took a dump.
You can get a cow up three flights of stairs, but you ca n't get it down!
And that's why in the end he said, "Who wants steak for dinner?"
How are you boys doing?
- You think I'm fat?
Seriously, Phil here thinks I got fat with old age.
You're a big man with an even bigger heart.
I love this woman.
Do n't let him get into too much trouble.
They'll have grounds for impeachment when we're done with him.
We better get another drink before they close up.
You're gonna be the waiter tonight.
Hold on a second there, partner.
You had no idea we were coming?
I thought Higgins might've...
No, he played it perfectly.
Made me think you were n't coming at all.
We would n't have missed it for the world.
On the library, are they gonna put Frank or Francis?
Francis is better for libraries.
I got a few of those.
Does anybody ever actually call you Francis?
She's the only one.
She seems like a real prize.
Bar was already shut down, but look what I scored.
Paul, did you invite him here?
Did you ask him here after we said all those times that we're not gonna let him bother you?
He screwed you over one too many times.
Who you talking about?
I'm talking about Peter Russo at the front door.
Did you ask him here, or did he just come on his own?
No, I'm not gonna stop until you actually deal with it and get rid of him.
Paul, you got a minute to talk?
There's nothing to talk about.
And I want to talk about the shipyard.
I got a plan to fix it.
You do n't want everything going into the Roth IRA.
Five, ten grand a year, and I'll set you up with a nice diversified package, low risk, high yield.
I think Claire and I have things pretty well under control.
If I brought a senior U.S. Congressman into the fund, that would really up my stock in the company.
What're you all gabbing about back there?
We were talking about the old library.
Yeah, what's happening to it?
They gonna tear it down?
They could gut it, they could turn it into a student center.
Hey, we should sneak in there.
What the hell, why not?
The Association had about $3 million saved up in reserve for emergencies.
But you split that up between 12,000 members, it's nothing.
Couple weeks' groceries.
Major federal funds going towards public parks, green commercial spaces, cleaning up waste sites.
That's construction jobs, park management, retail...
That's not even half...
It's a start.
A year, maybe two...
What're we supposed to do until then?
Listen, there's a community meeting tomorrow...
You gonna be there?
I was n't planning on it.
I'd like you to be there.
You want me to vouch for you?
Listen, I'm gonna tell you something that only a handful of people know.
I'm running for governor.
Now I know I let you down with the shipyard, but if I win the governor's race I can get everything back on track.
You show up on my doorstep asking for my forgiveness, and now you want me to be your lapdog?
Okay, this Watershed Bill is just the beginning.
If I'm governor, there's so much I can do.
You just want to use me.
Yeah, it's exactly like that.
I did n't realize you and Frank were staying here.
We always stay here when we're in Charleston.
You know that, Remy.
I promise it was a coincidence.
My assistant booked it.
He's off cavorting with his old classmates. Hmm.
You want to sit down and have a drink?
They booked me the bridal suite.
There's champagne on ice...
My, my, you've grown very confident since you worked for Francis.
I've always been confident, Claire.
You never would've invited me upstairs.
The staff always stayed in the Best Western four blocks away.
Good night, Remy.
The bridal suite's on the top floor, at the end of the hallway, if you change your mind.
Good night, Claire.
Hey, Kenny, I think you got a little too big for this.
I think the hole got a lot smaller.
Do n't let a little girth stop you.
Yeah, look, it's still there.
Wow, look at that.
Good, and you?
I'm in Charleston, actually.
I thought I'd surprise you.
Come on, let me show you where I went through puberty.
I can totally see you here at 16.
Got in some trouble on this bed, huh?
Which is what my mother told me, in her own special way.
Am I gonna meet her?
You do n't want to meet her.
I just want to stop by, say hey, see her face.
I'm officially convinced that you're the most amazing woman I've ever been with.
But I meant it when I said I wanted to take this trip alone.
Which is why I came.
To be here for you. Moral support.
I know these people, they're going to lay into me big time.
Tomorrow's an important day for the campaign.
Do n't fight me on this.
So do I get a hotel?
A hotel would be more comfortable.
But it would be a waste of valuable campaign funds.
You see that crack up in the ceiling?
I know every inch and curve.
I'm scared of the dark!
Let there be light!
How come you and Frank have never had kids?
You've never had kids.
Yeah, but I'm not married.
We just decided not to.
There was n't some big conversation.
I think you're lying.
Think whatever you want.
I mean, yeah, maybe once or twice.
I mean, I do n't feel there's some void.
I'm perfectly happy without.
Can you imagine me wiping a baby's ass and changing nappies?
No, I ca n't.
Actually, yes, I just did, I'm going to have to get off the phone.
We really should get off.
I'm hanging up right now.
No, I am.
Yeah! Let's go, Ken, let's go.
Go, go, go.
Come on, do n't quit on me.
But it's not a fair fight.
You run a rafting company. I sit behind a desk all day.
I'd love to see your ass with a paddle bouncing through a class - four rapid.
If I can whip Congress into submission, I'm not afraid of a little white water.
You ca n't tame a rapid, Frank.
My heart is beating so fast.
If I have a heart attack it's your fault.
I need another drink.
I think I'll have another, too.
Do n't bogart that.
Do you think this place made us?
When I walked on campus today I wondered, did it mean anything?
If it's just a place we spent four years of our lives or was there more?
I knew that the moment I saw you cuss out the drill sergeant when we were knobs.
The library is a sham.
Higgins asked me a favor, I asked someone else a favor, they slapped my name on it.
Or knows how to deliver on them.
In 50 years, they'll just replace it with something else, just like they're doing with this for mine.
The library does n't matter.
But I want to think that this place did.
I think it meant a lot to us, then.
Honestly, I have n't really thought about it that much.
It's a long time ago.
We were so close.
We messed around a couple of times.
I was so drawn to you...
I could always make you laugh.
How did we lose touch?
You went to law school. I joined the army.
You ran for Congress. I moved to Colorado.
Thirty years goes by.
I got children older than we were back then.
Do you have anyone, Frank?
If I want someone, I want them.
It made me happy to make you happy, Frank.
Did n't see any harm in it.
When you're on the water, all you're thinking about is what's right in front of you.
Everything is in the moment.
I do n't really have time to think about the past.
You meant something to me.
I do n't feel so well...
You gonna be sick?
Can we just stay here for a little bit?
Until I feel better.
It's almost 7:00.
I do n't even remember going to sleep...
1,100 acres of development.
45% shopping and office space.
Who is he that they're naming the place after?
Some guy who went here.
I think he's dead.
We had to set up the chairs yesterday.
I'm gonna try to get some shut - eye before the ceremony.
I'll see you all later?
Hey, Frank, before I forget, here's my card, so your money manager can call me.
You look like you're hurting.
It was an all - nighter.
Was it fun at least?
I need to get some shut - eye.
Remy's staying here.
He harassing you about the donation?
Go get some rest.
I was n't a starter, but I got my time on the court.
I think you look sexier now, all grown up.
We're ready for you.
You said two years.
Yeah, I think two years is a realistic estimate.
Which I think it will.
You think or you know?
I ca n't predict 100%, but I'm confident it will.
You think, you're confident, you ca n't predict 100%, how does any of that help us?
I'll tell you something, I'm 100% unable to pay my mortgage right now.
I'm 100% unable to buy my kids school supplies.
We supposed to live off my husband's disability?
There'll be paid training programs available.
How much will they pay?
Granted, it's less than you made at the shipyard.
It's about $6 an hour.
That's not even minimum wage.
You have to see it as an investment.
The training programs are a valuable resource...
You're not getting it.
I ca n't afford to make investments.
$6 an hour puts my family on the street.
What, do you want me to work five jobs?
You want to know what I think?
I think you sit around in Washington coming up with all sorts of fancy numbers and solutions that look good on paper, but that does n't cut it for the rest of us.
We do n't eat paper for dinner.
You ca n't put a paper roof over your head.
When we all voted for you, I did n't think that every one of those votes was another nail in our own coffins.
Please, everybody, just sit down for 10 minutes, we can go over this proposal point - by - point.
And you can get the information you need to get the resources that you want...
It's like they do n't want to find a solution.
I understand that they're scared, but that does n't mean they ca n't listen...
You do n't know these people, Christina.
I worked in your office for three years.
I spoke to them, I took their calls, I replied to their emails...
You did n't grow up with them.
I do n't need to grow up hand - to - mouth to empathize with the fact that...
They're not interested in empathy.
The house keys are in my jacket.
Do your homework or Sister Mary Joseph...
Do n't lie to me.
I used to use the same ploy with my parents.
We do the homework, and then we eat.
- What do you guys want?
Sweetheart, take the kids upstairs.
How'd you get in here?
You still keep the spare key behind the loose brick on the porch.
You break into my house?
We gotta talk, Paul.
We talked last night.
I can convince these people, but I need your help.
I do n't want to have to hurt you with my children upstairs, Petey.
I do n't want to fight you, Petey.
I do n't want to fight you either.
I will, but we do n't have to.
But I could n't forestall the inevitable.
The shipyard was closing.
If not this year, then next, or the year after.
We all know that.
I could have lied to you.
I could have pretended to do more.
But I do n't believe in living in the past.
I only care about the future.
I'm all you've got.
Whatever you think of Petey, we either go with him or we got nothing.
Now does what I'm offering you come anywhere near what you want or deserve?
But you gotta open your eyes and take what's in front of you.
We can build on that.
5,000 jobs becomes 10, then 15.
Not in the snap of a finger, but faster than doing nothing will.
Can I count on all of you?
All right, I'll take that as a yes.
We'll need your contact information, so we can send you materials to share with your friends.
Now, let's talk about the way the money's gonna get phased in.
It's gonna happen in six stages.
Left face, forward march.
Francis Underwood's career, Harvard Law degree, one of the youngest state legislators in the history of South Carolina, a 22 - year veteran of the U. S. Congress,
House Majority Whip, speaks volumes about the values young people learn here at the Sentinel, values like honor, duty, discipline, like sacrifice, service and respect.
Ladies and Gentlemen, the Francis J. Underwood library.
I wrote a speech.
But I'm not gonna read it.
Not even this building.
I do n't mean to sound ungrateful.
I am very grateful, I'm deeply honored,
I had the good fortune of spending most of this weekend with a group of friends.
Friends I have n't seen in a very long time.
Most of you young cadets probably do n't know who I am.
But I do n't blame you.
When I was your age, why, I did n't care much for what men in gray hair did or what they had to say.
I wish I could describe...
That's the word that's stuck in my mind.
It's not about what's lasting or permanent.
It is about individual voices coming together for a moment,
and that moment lasts the length of a breath.
That's what I think about my time here.
You'll have to forgive me.
You know, when I was a cadet, we could drink all night, then get up in the morning and march 20 miles, but these days I'm lucky I got up these three steps.
I want to thank you very much.
I want to thank President Higgins, and of course, the love of my life, Claire.
I told you about her yesterday.
Hi, Mrs. Russo.
We just came by to say goodbye.
We have to catch a train in about an hour.
They still have n't fixed that light?
Things went well today.
I think the folks in the yard are going to get behind me.
Peter did a great job.
Hand me that blanket.
AC in here is nuts.
What happened to your hand?
I got in a fight.
That's my Peter.
I'm just messing with ya.
Hold on a second.
Yeah, my mother's in room 409.
She has a light out that needs to be replaced.
All right. I'll take care of it.
What you want me to wear?
The light in my mother's room.
I told you I'll take care of it later.
You'll take care of it now.
You're very welcome, sir.
Real proud of you, Frank.
I hate to admit it, but I feel the same.
Well, having all you here is what made it special.
Now, you stay in touch.
See you, buddy.
Beautiful ceremony, Frank.
Yeah, they did a good job.
I'm glad I was here for that.
You should come out to Salida sometime.
I'll take you out on the Arkansas River.
Edward has the car ready.
Looks like the shipbuilders are on board.
Tomorrow morning we start working on his draft for his announcement speech.
I got that with me.
Ride with me to the airport, we can go through it in the car.
Want to get a beer?
It's not going to trial, I got it.
Checks go to Quorta.
You've been re-assigned to Skip Hadderly.
He must have said something.
He must have given a reason why.
No, he did n't.
He does n't have to.
He just said he wants a new intern.
Michael amended his will two months ago.
I'm sure you understand this sets off alarm bells within his family.
$500,000 was left in the name of Chelsea Rayne.
Are you Chelsea Rayne?
Do n't ever do that again!
I thought that was you.
It's great seeing you.
You look beautiful as always.
Pleasure to meet you.
You guys just had lunch?
You should try the sea scallops, they're amazing.
I had them last time.
Anyway, I do n't mean to intrude.
I just wanted to say hi.
- It's good seeing you.
I spoke with Peter Gramercy, off the record.
Cilic's kids are now aware that you've been left half - a- million dollars of their father's money, and they're going to fight it.
I could have predicted that.
We should assume they're gonna do their best to expose you as an escort, which could also open you up to criminal charges.
Do you know what the estate's worth?
Did Gramercy tell you?
Again, off the record,
And they're willing to drag their father's name through all of this, for a fortieth of the estate?
Could be a bluff, but we should err on the side of caution.
What was the name of the man you were with the other day?
No, it's Alex.
Do you often see older men?
I mean I assume he's a client of yours, right?
Can I ask you something?
Will you tell me the truth?
What's your real name?
Do you like being an escort?
There are four bedrooms, four bathrooms, and a two - car garage.
The master bedroom is on the upper level.
The floor to ceiling, wall - to - wall glass provides stunning views of the lake.
Would you live here?
Are you asking me to move in?
But not bad, though, right?
No, it's beautiful.
Some close friends of mine,
Steve, and his wife, Ana, are throwing a dinner party this Thursday.
You'd really like them.
Sometimes Steve and I do business together and Ana owns The Cermark, that really cool art gallery in the West Loop.
So it's a double date?
If you want to think of it that way.
I told them that we've been seeing each other.
So, will you come?
I mean I have to check my schedule, but I'm sure it's fine.
You make me really happy.
I'm really happy we finally get to meet you.
Jack's been talking about you for weeks.
I have n't seen Jack this happy in a while.
He does n't deserve you.
You do n't deserve me.
He's the one who should be embarrassed, hiding you away for so long.
Do you want to come back to my place?
You're gonna go, now?
I was n't expecting to stay the night.
I have something to take care of in the morning.
I had a wonderful time tonight.
I feel very close to you.
I feel very close to you, too.
Will you call me tomorrow?
I need you to do a clearance search on these, asap.
Make note of anything that seems even remotely questionable.
Hi, what's your name?
Hi, Corey, I'm Christine.
I'm having some trouble accessing some files on the main frame.
May I have your last name?
"Reade." With an "e" on the end.
And which files are you trying to access?
I just accessed them yesterday.
You do n't have authorization anymore.
Your access has been terminated.
You'll need Tellis' approval.
Stop touching me there!
I'm sorry, I'm really ticklish.
It's not funny.
Oh, absolutely not.
My wife and I used to do this on sailing trips.
I should have said "ex - wife".
No, I just never heard you talk about her before.
I did n't feel like I knew you before.
Well, you do now.
I do wish you were a little mad right now.
You want me to trash talk your ex?
No, she's great.
It's always about me.
What's he offering?
Can you get it higher?
You wanna come?
I'll watch you.
- You're getting out?
- I'm done.
I was just playing around.
I have something for you.
Only if you answer one question.
- When you dunked me...
- No, with the guy.
The guy that you were talking to at the pool.
Did you know him?
He asked me if I was alone, I said "no".
Were you attracted to him?
Just answer the question.
I was n't even paying attention.
I bought the house.
The one overlooking the lake.
I do n't know what to say.
I bought it for us.
So that we'd have a place of our own.
So we did n't have to keep going to hotels.
You can decorate it however you want.
I thought you would like it.
No one's ever done anything like this for me before.
Yeah, that should be fine.
I'll just check and get back to you.
Last night was incredible.
I'll get back to you about Tuesday.
Did you leave it upstairs?
I always do this.
Can I speak with Erin for a moment?
- Is it a good time?
I hear you're heading the XHP case now.
I'd love to be involved and help in any way I can.
I was involved when David was heading it and I'd like to see it through.
It's a bit of a mess right now, but I'll see what I can do.
If they were smart, you'd be the new Managing Partner.
Is everything okay between you and David?
So, how's work?
They're on a hiring freeze.
Less positions, more profits.
- Who knows how long...
- Where do you intern again?
A small law firm in midtown.
Peters and Morgan. It's two guys.
It turns you on.
It turns me on.
How did you get this number?
You gave it to me.
I did n't give you this number, Jack.
Congrats on the promotion.
So my phone got stolen.
And my sister got some weird texts.
So if you got any weird messages...
- Well, great news for you.
Hey, I did n't hear from you yesterday and I got worried...
NEVER CALL ME AGAIN!
Hull breach in Sector Seven!
Our ship was the only one that could lock onto Megatron's warp signature.
Shields are doing a major fade!
Their shields are down!
Launch all pods. Get them in safe orbit!
Is this the right planet?
Field readings are off the scale.
Continued exposure to robotic forms will result in permanent damage.
Then we will create alternate forms based on the most powerful local creatures!
How's about I cut meeces to pieces?
Living large is for forms like me RHINOX.
We may need Energon for power, but this is too much of a good thing
Our robot forms will start to short out after a few minutes' exposure.
This is one unusual planet whatever it is.
The TransWarp drive can go through space an' time.
We were locked onto Megatron's warp signature.
We could be anyplace anytime.
And our crew is orbiting the planet in those stasis pods we lost in battle.
They're protected from the Energon fields but it means Megatron has us outnumbered.
This can not be Earth!
Not only did you FAIL to destroy the Maximals when you had the chance you FAILED to bring us to the right planet!
You are an idiot and an incompetent leader.
And I - am taking over!
The winner shall lead the Predacons
- and the loser shall be destroyed!
There is more to being a leader than simple courage.
What does it matter which planet we are on?
Enough energon to power the Predacons' entire Galactic Conquest!
Only the Maximals could give us trouble now if they survived the crash.
And if you find them - destroy them!
All this fer a Golden Disk.
It gave the location of a major Energon source.
That's why Megatron stole it. Yeah, like I care!
Playing Galactic Patrol was n't nowhere in my job description.
We ca n't let that happen. Besides, you wanted exploration, and here we are on an unknown planet.
Just no pleasing some people.
They're fast, all right. You chose a good form. Hey, you think that's speed?
You ai n't seen the Golden Rocket.
Return to base immediately!
We do n't have time for this!
No good. Th' Energon fields mess up th' comlinks.
Anything over a hundred meters they ai n't worth scrap.
So this yer first day on th' job or what?
It's just a big bug.
Hm. The way those two reacted that's no natural life - form.
And if we're talking unnatural life - forms, then we gotta be talking about just one thing.
Time for this cat to pounce!
We'll swat that pesky Predacon!
There has been peace between the Maximals and Predacons for centuries.
for the right moment -- to strike!
Ya mean like this?
I'm - I'm stuck!
We'll cover you!
Do not let them escape!
Energon field build - up.
I am Commander of this group.
So I get vaped because you're too chicken to go yourself?
But I was capable of giving you better cover fire.
It will take time for our Beast Forms to effect internal repairs.
Maybe he was destroyed in th' crash.
I have left the Predacons to join your group - as leader.
Did I hear the word 'leader'?
This guy's got bearings of chrome steel.
And the loser - shall be destroyed!
Time's running out, is n't it?
We got nothing but time, asshole.
Your boys think you're in here with your bodyguard.
How you gonna get out of here, genius?
You even think about that?
Just like a couple of Geckos.
What did you say to me?
It's the labyrinth, man.
Killing Boss Hogg might be the wrong move.
Do n't let it push your buttons.
Well, maybe I'll let it show me the truth from inside your screwed - up head.
He did n't burn up on the couch.
You doused him with lighter fluid while he was drunk.
Now will you let me get back to work?
Just get it open.
Tell them you're fine.
Hang back, boys!
Even a blind squirrel finds an occasional testicle, does n't he?
What do you know?
This has got to be it.
It's got to be what?
This door handle, or whatever the hell it is, is how we started this hall of mirrors in the first place.
We found the Sasak Ukib.
Richie, what are you doing?
Jesus Christ, Richie!
The serpent is filled with her blood.
I knew that it was coming.
Well, I did n't.
That's our way to the top.
You still got that $30 mill strapped to yourself?
It's time to settle up.
I do n't know who you are anymore.
I do n't know what you are.
I guess I'm just the guy who killed Dad.
Scott, your sister's in danger.
I can take care of this if you want me to.
Go find my daughter.
Carlos wanted you here for a reason.
Your blood is so pure.
At least for now, before they realize that their precious Santanico is gone.
It's all you.
Who would n't want to eat all that filling?
Welcome to the party sherrif.
That's why you did n't get affected by the queen's bite.
I've read about you.
You got a hell of a bloodline there, compadre.
It was you the whole time.
Well, only one way to Carnegie Hall, and that's practice, practice...
I'm not a sheriff.
Did you find Scott?
You may feel like you're greater than Human, but you're not.
This is n't you.
And I just saved your life.
Scott, something evil and vicious has taken hold of you.
You're gonna have to feed on innocent blood to survive.
You wo n't be able to live with yourself.
Stop being a goddamn pastor!
I never really was a part of this family!
You're a child of God.
And I want you to find peace in Heaven.
Not if you've killed so many.
We came here to be a family again.
We still can be.
You think you can slaughter the counselors and the lords will stand for it?
By the time I'm finished with them, they wo n't be standing at all.
You're gonna start the revolution.
Why do n't you write a song about it?
Wrap a snake around your tits and dance.
That's all you're good for.
What's with all the shouting?
Narciso's a stand - up guy.
He saved my ass once.
Welcome to the Twister.
Can I get you anything?
You know what I want?
I want a gold medal.
I want a podium.
I want to hear the national anthem playing while the goddamn blue angels fly over my head, and then I think I want to be on some cereal boxes, because in case you have n't noticed, Carlito,
I got it.
You're forgetting about something.
The bonds are in a safe place.
That's exactly where they're gonna stay.
What are you talking about, Seth?
I'm talking about my take, Richard, for this whole miserable job.
Two jobs, actually...
The bank robbery that nearly got me killed and your little imaginary heist that nearly got me buried...
So you're just gonna take my money, too?
Slithering around in your gullet.
This is where I get off.
Your brother and I need that money.
Think my brother's gonna be just fine without it.
- Well, I wo n't be.
She's your boss, not mine.
When you bite someone, it's like...
It's like you can feel their life run right through you.
It's because blood is the conduit of the soul.
It's what makes us Human.
She needed help, and you just left it all in God's hands.
Your mother made her choice.
What she did, she did to herself.
No, it was your fault.
He did n't, Scott.
I know the truth.
He suffered all alone for us, Scott.
Like he always does.
Scott, what did you do?
Come on, dad.
Come on, pastor.
No, Daddy, stop.
Where do you want to go?
We came here to find a new path, and look...
What is, Scott?
You gonna turn us all into monsters?
Are you gonna turn me into a monster?
You gonna turn me into a monster, like you?
Kate, do n't!
- Scott, no.
You guys deserve each other.
Katey, you listen to me...
I wo n't let him near us.
If he's gonna survive, he needs you.
You need each other.
And what about you?
Your brother's right.
You ca n't go back to Bethel.
And I do n't think your dad can go back, either.
You know how this has to end.
Well, I guess Uncle Eddie was right.
I thought you were leaving.
It's one thing to ditch your brother, another to leave him outnumbered in a fight.
You do n't really expect to walk out of here?
It was a goddamn bloodsucker rave, and I'm still standing.
So I'm warning you, slick...
You better find another way to make some cash, 'cause today ai n't your payday.
Tell us where the bonds are.
Let's finish this without bloodshed.
You kill me, you're never gonna find out.
You're jealous, Carlos, so you make a deal with my captors?
Do n't be so angry, mi amor.
"Find their Gods... And you'll find their gold."
That's what I believed.
I had found love.
I never stopped loving you.
Do not lie to me!
I could never hate you as much as you hate yourself.
I did everything for you.
I slaughtered my own men, I betrayed my God.
So you can go to bed with this pinche criminal?
The venom will cripple him.
But it will keep what's inside of him alive until I decide to set you free.
Perhaps I'll make you my slave now.
Who you calling a criminal, asshole?
You still think I'm a slave.
In here, I'm the queen!
It's all your fault.
Excuse me, my fault?
You wanted to leave with all the money.
Because it's my money.
Oh, trust me... I saw.
Richie already told me all about you and Carlito.
He double - crossed me with the same monsters who imprisoned me here.
What would Seth Gecko do if he got betrayed like this?
You turned my brother into a goddamn slave.
He's not a slave!
How can I imprison someone when I've been in chains my whole life?
You're the victim.
- I'm no one's victim.
Carlos is gonna call you.
He's gonna offer you a deal.
I want my freedom.
That much, I deserve.
Well, you do n't have the money yet, do you?
Who else, Narciso, has so consistently provided for the nine houses? Hmm?
I have always provided for them.
You are going to tell them that Santanico was the one that betrayed us.
You are going bring them the $30 million prize.
Seth thinks it's just about the money, but those oil bonds are the key to so much more.
I can walk right out that door with the $30 mill, and you ca n't even follow me.
You would n't do that to Richard.
I know what he did to your father, Seth.
I need your brother, Seth.
I ca n't bring down the nine lords without him.
I do n't care about your stupid crusade.
Oh, but you will.
The nine houses may live in the shadows, Seth, but they have great power in this realm.
They have more wealth than you can even imagine.
I already got what I need.
It's never enough.
You do n't love the money.
You love stealing it.
Richard killed your father for a reason.
Well, why do n't you forgive whoever threw you in this hole, sweetheart?
Well, this is a nice change.
I spend all day chasing you down.
Now you're calling me.
What do you know?
You got 10 minutes, Seth.
Then after that, it's one finger for each minute.
And then, after that, it's one stake through his heart.
Did you hear me, Seth?
There's all kinds of markings on these walls.
If this is where those things get made, maybe they can get unmade.
You really can see it.
Our life... The future.
You really can see us being happy again.
I believe it's possible.
That's the trick, is n't it?
We ca n't stop.
- I'm sorry, Katey - kakes.
I might even destroy it.
This whole future that you see... It can not be.
Ranger Gonzalez, help me.
Kate, all I can tell you is what I've learned on the job.
Day in and day out, people like you, the victim...
There's one thing that's really important to them.
You do n't want to see me turn into a demon from hell.
And I do n't want to be one.
I wo n't do it.
I'm not gonna learn how to survive with it.
He's not set in his ways.
But I can not abide killing another human being.
Now you're just being selfish!
You're so selfish.
You just want to go to Heaven so you can be with Mama.
I'm not so sure she's gonna be there.
She tried to kill herself.
God, you ca n't believe that.
He does n't live on the pages of some book.
Now, you hold on a second.
No, he does n't.
This whole trip's been about... Trying to find him.
Who knew I'd find him in the walls of this... Pagan temple...
And in my baby girl's eyes?
Yes, I do.
I love you, Katey - kakes.
Technically, it's only $26 million, but Carlos does n't need to know that.
Are you certain about using the real thing?
First thing Carlito's gonna do is check.
You just got to make sure your girls know what to do.
Do you think it's possible for someone to change their fate?
I think you're well on your way, sister.
I mean, anybody crosses you, you can rip their guts out with your bare hands, right?
It's our fate to live in the shadows.
Well, maybe you ought to stop destroying people's lives.
I do what I do to survive.
I was wrong about you.
Save it, okay?
Not gonna work on this Gecko.
You saved him from a lifetime of agony.
He's at peace with Mama.
That's what he wanted.
Maybe that's what God wanted.
I've had this feeling all day.
Felt like that since the liquor store this morning.
Like... Somebody's been leading me down a path.
Carlos spelled it out for me.
Said I was part of a war that I can never escape... That I'd pay the price... That I'd lose my wife and daughter.
And you'd believe that man before you believe your own heart?
I hope my Billy grows up to be like you.
Are you being held in here?
Six months of rehab, and I'm back on track.
The system took me in when my mom fell so far off the wagon, she fell 6 feet under.
It's all right now, though.
I've got it all figured out.
Got what figured out?
Exactly where to go with my life from here.
I'm not gonna let my daddy's ghost haunt me anymore.
My daddy walked out the day before I was supposed to be baptized.
And my mom was so screwed up by it, she never got around to doing it.
So today, I'm finally being baptized.
Yeah, this place will do that to you.
I do n't know about you, but I'm famished.
You know, Narciso has a cook with him at all times.
El pinche flaco does n't put on weight.
You do n't look so good.
You're hungry, are n't you?
I fed in the labyrinth.
Yeah, you imagined feeding in the labyrinth.
And now that you're the prince, you got to stay in shape, bro.
She will tire of you, even if it takes five centuries.
You know, I provided many services to the lords.
You guys look like you're about to get into an underwear - only pillow fight.
Carlito, I got to tell you, the sun can not come up fast enough on this day.
As long as he stops screwing this up, maybe.
You know, it's funny this whole thing kind of reminds me of this job that we pulled about seven years ago in Cheyenne.
Yeah, it did n't just go sideways. It went three ways.
We pulled it off, though, did n't we, brother?
You remember Cheyenne, do n't you?
Let's get this over with.
- Soon as you uncuff him, we'll talk.
Do n't go near him, Carlos.
He's gonna get me killed.
He's gonna try something like Phoenix six years ago.
- It was n't as crazy as Cheyenne.
- Forget about Cheyenne!
I ca n't believe you sold us out to get in bed with these freaks.
Not my fault you ca n't see the big picture, brother.
I'm learning, fast!
You do n't learn.
- Gentlemen, please!
Let him go. I'll hand it over.
He beat you on the daily, and you give him a pass and not me?
- He's blood.
They did n't know what hit'em.
Yeah, I know the feeling.
You're not gonna turn.
I did n't pump any venom into you.
Look, I had a plan, Richard...
Why could n't you just trust me?
Because in Cheyenne, we had an argument.
It needed to be more than that.
In Phoenix, we let the pricks think that I killed you.
Well, in Phoenix, you were n't a goddamn succubus, were you?
Boys, it's time. Aah!
Told you it was gonna be a long day.
You're gonna pay for the trail of bodies you left behind today, going all the way back to Earl.
Or I'll put this stake through his goddamn heart.
What are you, nuts?
Why are you hesitating, rinche, hmm?
That's what your bloodline is begging you to do, and yet you ca n't do it.
Maybe he does n't have the stones.
You want to save your family from what's coming?
You're making a big mistake, Ranger.
I'm gonna drop this stake, and I'm gonna walk out of here.
And none of you freaks better come after me or my family...
I'm cool if you're cool.
You can keep that.
What about Richie and Seth?
I have a feeling whatever they're into, they're never gonna be free of.
Be able to get back on your own?
Honestly, I have no idea where I'm going.
But I think, after tonight, I'm gonna be fine.
Take care of yourself, Kate.
You take care of your little girl.
Well, if that do n't get me religion, I do n't know what will.
You ca n't walk in the sun.
You said you were always just trying to save me, Seth.
Now you have to let me go.
Buddy, we just pulled it off out there.
If it was, you would've just taken the money.
You ever find that beach and blue agave, you let me know.
Maybe I'll come join you.
But not in that.
We should be hunting her down.
Eh, sorry, Carlitos, but the order comes straight from on high.
Yeah, they love their games, even if they did just lose.
You know I'll never make it out.
Is it a birthday party?
Mom, this is n't a "Star Wars" cake.
Yes, it is.
That's the "Star Wars" bear.
No, no, that's not a good name.
You know, I knew a Greek bear once.
You're right, Louis.
I am good at throwing parties.
- Uh, I did n't say anything
- Look at the pinata.
It's in great shape.
No one can tell we've used it since Eddie was 2.
This year, I filled it with cereal.
How much wrapping paper did you guys use?
We got him pogs.
Is the camera okay?
I fell on a hot wheel.
Before we start yelling, just remember, the force works in mysterious ways.
Eddie's birthday is next week.
It's time to start repairing the decorations.
All the other guys are still there, unrolling their sleeping bags, but not me.
You will thank me when you do n't get pedophiled.
Are those the birthday - party decorations?
I do n't want a party this year.
I'm almost a teenager.
So no party at all?
It's okay, mom.
I know they take you so long to make.
No need to do anything special.
I'm glad we did this.
So, how do we feel about this?
And we'll have a free Saturday.
We can go to work.
I have n't gotten to work on a Saturday in years!
Let's carry Eddie's present down together.
Where are all the streamers and scallion pancakes and birthday hats?
We're not doing a party this year.
You know that, right?
Why did n't you tell us there was no party?
Because we're your parents.
We do n't have to tell you things.
Remember, no gyros from the food court.
I do n't trust meat without bones.
I do n't smell any poison.
The termite guy said we would n't smell anything.
I thought you were n't gonna come today because you were busy celebrating Eddie's birthday.
Eddie said he did n't want a birthday party this year.
So, this year, I showed up with horses, and we rode them to the olive garden.
I would n't joke about that, Louis.
Flew right into the sun.
Let's go find Eddie.
I miss how serious he looks when he makes a wish.
It is special when he concentrates.
Louis, his friends threw him a surprise birthday party.
Mitch, you came!
I would n't miss your dirty dozen.
You know, I've been thinking, we're such good kids that mom and dad forget about us.
That's why they did n't tell us that they cancelled Eddie's party.
I'm sick of being a good boy.
Why do I always hurt the ones I love?
Maybe we should start being bad.
Let's ask mom if it's okay.
Do you remember where we parked the car?
rated PG - 13.
Sounds pretty "chill."
Evan and I saw a movie today.
A PG - 13 movie.
It was unsuitable for ages under 13.
We saw you, Eddie!
And why was Mitch there?
Oh, so you did want a party!
You just did n't want to have it with us.
You're embarrassed of us, you and Mitch.
I'm not embarrassed!
We would have been happy to host your friends here.
It's just different when you're around.
Oh, but not when Mitch is around?
You're yourself with us, with the rap music and the sleeping.
You guys have this idea of me, but I'm more than just that.
Well, how are you different around your friends?
Be that way at home, then!
There's so many rules around here, I can never relax!
You only have one self.
I am always myself.
It does n't matter where I am.
I'm not so good.
Would a good kid do this?
React! This is not okay!
You think Eddie's right, do n't you?
You think we're too strict.
I think we're good parents.
Our rules are there for a reason.
I liked you better when you were worried about Mitch.
They've talked like three times!
We have to up our game.
What's up, Jessica?
Is Eddie in the kitchen?
It's like we're ghosts.
How about pop-tarts instead?
You said you would n't buy those because preservatives make you go blind.
Are you guys getting a divorce?
Can I stop wearing underwear?
I will go tonight.
I do n't trust Dave.
His own father does n't want to sleep there.
You can sleep over at Dave's.
I will just stand outside and look in the window.
He'll just be three houses down.
Have a great time, son.
Until he comes home.
I just cracked you a cold one.
Dude, my mom does n't care.
Are you looking at him?
Okay. Watch him take them.
I'll be sure he takes his vitamins before bed.
You have a dog?
Yeah, my mom just found him on the bus.
After the best instrument.
How about this instrument?
Once we run away, they'll really be sorry.
I heard their cheesesteaks are amazing.
I wo n't disturb you.
Take all the time you need.
I just want to see if I could see my son at Dave's house through your living - room window.
Is she holding up?
He loved you very much.
Is my wife here?
Jessica, what are you doing?
I'm just making sure he's okay.
He's never gonna know.
Whatever's easiest for you.
Light swords in the house.
Looks like he's having fun.
That's what we wanted.
Your brother's dead.
And the Huangs are here.
I'd never be able to play this game at home.
Pause, pause, pause.
That cereal is made of little cookies!
Dude, this is our dinner.
I love the way you live.
Not for long, though.
Dude, you're getting ice cream on my pillow!
Just rub it in.
- Go to bed, damnit.
- I hate you back!
I wish you were dead!
Oh, put it on your Christmas wish list!
If I talked to my mom that way, she'd kill me.
and then I would be killed.
That's not weird.
What's weird about my house?
Dude, you fart on your mom!
I just wanted to come home.
And then... I did n't.
I like being with my friends, but I like being at home, too.
Do you want me to make you birthday noodles?
Does n't that take like six hours?
It is for my son.
Are those Eddie's birthday noodles?
What are you doing up so late?
Wait. Where are you going?
It took me six hours to make these noodles.
Noodles, then bed, then grounded.
Your noodles or your rules.
Chew with your mouth closed.
So I said, "ma' am, you can stay, but your dog's got to go."
When did you guys become friends?
Well, we were in the service together.
What are you talking about?
An old man with dementia staped me on the street
I have to form myself, as I have never really formed before, and try to help you to form some sort of reasoned estimate of the most romantic figure in the recent history of mathematics.
Ramanujan was an Indian, and I suppose that it is always a little difficult for an Englishman and an Indian to understand one another properly.
I owe more to him than to anyone else in the world, and my association with him is the one romantic incident of my life.
He was, in a way, my discovery.
I did not invent him.
The difficulty for me, then, is not that I do not know enough about him, but that I know and feel too much.
You can also see I've been conducting my own mathematical researches.
You've no degree.
I'll write you a recommendation.
With all due respect, sir, I have recommendations.
What I need is a job.
I have a wife.
You people are all the same.
I'm doomed, like Galileo.
He died in poverty, you know.
Whatever is written in your fate will happen.
You ca n't change that.
My fate is to have a wife who lives with my mother while I sleep here with you all because the British think I'm a raving lunatic.
As do we Indians.
Where did you get your degree?
I do n't have one.
- How many do you have?
- Who else have you shown this to?
They all send me to someone else.
I can offer you a job, but your evenings will have to be spent in helping me understand this.
- Most certainly, sir.
Send for your wife so you can be together.
And put this on.
Sir Francis, here are today's ledgers.
Narayana, how long have you worked for me?
Since I helped to design the bridge on the Godavari, which now requires me to call you "Sir".
- Get him out of here.
Forgive my appearance, but I really am quite exceptional with numbers.
What you might see now is ordinary glass, I promise you will soon remain to see a diamond.
Your accounts had better be half as polished as your ego.
Amma, this is it.
It's the best I could do for now.
It's a home.
I will sleep on the floor.
I have to go back to work now.
Why are n't you using the abacus?
It was faster in my head.
If Sir Francis comes here, at least pretend to use this.
I see you've been working on your own formulas.
Paper is a precious commodity here.
Ramanujan, we need to seek an audience with someone who really understands all this.
I've been to everyone in Madras.
Did you know that the name derives from Mandarajya?
"The realm of the stupid."
There's a whole world out there.
And there's England.
You do n't come home.
It is I who owe the apology for keeping him.
I think it's enough for tonight, Ramanujan.
I was told you love numbers more than people.
Perhaps we can start over.
And I am your wife.
What does it all do?
It's like a painting, I think.
Only imagine it is with colors you can not see.
What good is that?
Not much for you, I'm afraid.
But for me it is everything.
Maybe there is someone else who can see and understand it as well.
And for them it will be important.
Have you met them?
I want to understand more than just colors I ca n't see.
What do you see?
Imagine, if we could look so closely, we could see each grain, each particle.
You see, There are patterns in everything.
The reflections on water.
In maths, these patterns reveal themselves in the most incredible form.
You should sleep in the bed.
I have made a friend in my boss.
He's going to find somebody to understand my work outside Madras.
That is an honor.
What nonsense are you talking?
He surely sees enough of you.
You're never here at home.
Ramanujan, listen to me.
This work is too important to die with you.
It must be published.
If you, an Indian, are at the pinnacle with these formulas, then the British, even while they subjugate us, must recognize that our brightest matches theirs.
You have been alone in your mind your whole life.
Now other people have the chance to understand you.
Not just your Namagiri.
All I do is imagine.
He's a real pot stirrer.
You know, he single - handedly reformed the entire Tripos examination system.
Turned over hundreds of years of history.
He's your man.
Kings, prime ministers.
Now perhaps even you.
Trouble on the Continent?
We beat the Frogs by a goal at Twickenham.
Ah, the Balkans.
You've got one there seems particularly well traveled.
Do you think it's another hoax?
"I beg to introduce myself as a clerk in the Accounts Department."
- What this time?
- Quite impressive, really.
Someone's gone to a lot of trouble.
And who claims he can give meaning to the negative values of the gamma function.
You know, Littlewood, this year alone, I've received correspondence from those who profess to prove the prophetic wisdom of the Pyramids, the revelations of the Elders of Zion,
But a letter from an ill - educated Indian clerk in Madras, challenging assertions I made in the tracts series, really takes the biscuit.
Well, I have to say, I've made similar assertions myself.
So you admit it?
But this was three years ago.
I'm talking about the letter.
I do n't know where you got the postmark.
I simply do n't know what you're talking about.
I do n't know how to get this into your thick skull, but whatever it is you're talking about,
You've missed Hall.
I tell you, there is a war coming, no doubt about it.
Because we are being led like mindless, spineless sheep and no one bothers to question any of it.
You can smell it.
You're as paranoid as Hardy.
With all due respect, Bertie, you could n't hold a candle.
Littlewood, could I have a word?
Oh, excuse me.
I always forget you do n't believe in a supreme being.
If this chap turns out to be genuine, you might have to reconsider.
He must be genuine.
Who would have the imagination to invent all that?
Well, I'm rather flattered you thought I did.
These two infinite series are the more intriguing.
They defeated me completely.
I've never seen anything like them.
Well, it's deceptive.
I'll wager the hypergeometric series.
Our great Littlewood, stumped.
He's Hobbs class, I'd say.
I would very highly value any advice you give me.
"Yours truly, S. Ramanujan."
What does the "S" stand for?
You can ask him yourself.
You intend to invite him here?
Much better, let him rot away in his office in Madras, hmm?
There seems to be a letter for you.
From a Mr. G. H. Hardy.
I used to come here and watch the boats leaving.
I always wondered what it would be like to be on one of them.
I'm finally here and you talk of crossing the sea?
It is forbidden for us.
If you go, it will never be the same.
This is not Calcutta or Bombay.
No one will even talk to us!
Then we will move to Calcutta or Bombay.
Besides, I do n't want to talk to anyone but you.
Do you promise to bring me as soon as you are able?
Then that is what we will do.
Are you sure you want me to do it?
You cut your hair.
Amma, I've decided to go to England.
Or did she convince you?
So that both of you could run away together?
This is all her doing.
She wants you all to herself.
Please look after each other while I'm gone.
Never forget your prayers.
You can not pollute yourself with their food, if you ever want to come back.
I've known larger numbers.
I'm sure it wo n't mean war.
All this Din, Din, Din.
Are you Ramanujan, by chance?
I was just on my way to meet you.
Well, shall we go together?
Do n't be intimidated.
Great knowledge often comes from the humblest of origins.
You see that sapling?
That's the very tree under which Newton sat, when the apple dropped on his head and he invented gravity.
Well, I think it's criminal.
I mean, we bring these Indians over at great expense and look what happens.
Yeah, well, it's not just that this chap is Ramjin, whatever his name is, is Indian.
After all, we do have Indian students here.
It's a disgrace.
Ramanujan is a special case.
We've all read his letter.
There are no proofs.
Are we just supposed to take him at his word?
Take it as a sign of respect to quieten this lot.
Is Mr. Hardy here?
I'm most excited to meet him.
He must be a very kind man to bring me all this way.
Speak of the devil.
Welcome to Trinity, Mr. Ramanujan.
Am I pronouncing that properly?
It's an honor, sir.
I very much look forward to beginning our work.
So, tomorrow, 10:00, my rooms.
Did I say something wrong?
I'll look out for you.
That's if you believe he actually exists.
You see, there's speculation that Mr. Littlewood here is merely a figment of Hardy's imagination.
If he ever makes a mistake, he'll have someone else to blame.
Welcome to our little asylum.
Get off the grass!
It's for Fellows only!
Could you direct me to New Court?
- To Mr. Hardy?
You have something on your forehead.
The shoes, they hurt my feet.
Sorry I'm late.
You see, you do exist.
Ramanujan, we've decided that for the good of everybody you should attend some lectures.
But I'm here to publish.
But first we need proofs of your work.
It's really nothing to worry about.
It's simply a question of acquainting you with the more formal methods that will benefit our future work together.
I mean, we need a common language.
You would n't expect us to converse with you in Tamil.
But you expect me to speak English.
So, there will be plenty of time for publishing.
I'm sorry, but with all humility, how does anyone know that?
I do n't want this to die with me.
I assure you it wo n't.
But I have much more to share with you.
As I told you, the letter only contained a small sampling of my discoveries.
You'll see I have even found a function which exactly represents the number of prime numbers less than X in the form of an infinite series.
I thought if we were going to publish, it should be something, uh, ground - breaking.
This is most unexpected.
This will take a lifetime.
It's quite alarming to see you so thoroughly pleased with yourself.
Ca n't have anything to do with these notebooks, can it?
You could spend the rest of your life trying to prove half of it and never have another original idea of your own.
If I could prove, by logic, that you are gonna die in five minutes, I'd be sorry, but my sorrow would be very much mitigated by the pleasure in the proof.
Might get your wish granted with half the Continent up in flames and old men like that running the show.
No, you're just a bit sore because you're worried he'll be up there before you are.
Hmm, I doubt a dark face will ever grace these walls, let alone become a Fellow.
Come over, sit with us.
- I'm Chandra Mahalanobis.
And this is Andrew Hartley.
Well, everyone knows who you are, mate.
Word's out you've taken on the prime number theorem.
It is quite extraordinary, them bringing you here like this.
You're from the South?
This must be quite a shock for you.
Truth is, you've more in common than you think.
His father was a schoolteacher.
Not exactly Trinity stock.
It's probably why he's taken to you.
Does he have a wife?
He's married to his work, as they say.
I suppose that means you now.
How's that any better?
The potatoes are cooked in lard.
But I think I will go.
I hope to see you soon.
Did you have a good dinner?
They make a fine mutton.
And your rooms?
I want everything to be to your advantage so that we can be as productive as possible.
Well, I'll say good night, then.
But you do n't appear to be taking any notes.
Is there something you'd like to contribute?
Well, come on, then.
You'll need the chalk.
I had n't completed that proof.
Well, gentlemen, it appears that our time is up.
Little wog, let me tell you something.
You do n't pull a stunt like that in my class.
You do n't belong here and you can tell your Master Hardy
I said as much!
How did it work with Mr. Howard?
How did you know that theorem?
It came to me.
Mr. Hardy, I do n't understand why we waste our time doing all these proofs.
I have the formulas.
It's not that I ca n't see what you've claimed.
It's that I'm not sure that you know how you got there or, indeed, that your claims are correct.
But they are right, sir.
I have more important new ideas.
Yes, but intuition is not enough.
It has to be held accountable.
And a little humility would go a long way.
Why do you think they want us to fail?
Because I am Indian.
Well, yeah, there is that.
But also because of what we represent.
Now, Euler and Jacobi.
Just names to you.
Euler was the most productive mathematician of the 18th century.
Most of his work done after he was blind.
Jacobi, like you, was snatched from obscurity, and was almost as impressive as Euler.
Now, I think you are in their class.
What they had in common, what I see in you, is a love of form.
It's all through your notebooks.
Because I have to.
Form for its own sake.
An art unto itself.
And, like all art, it reflects truth.
It's the only truth I know.
It's my church.
And you, just as Mozart could hear an entire symphony in his head, you dance with numbers to infinity.
But this dance, this art, does little to endear us to certain factions who see us as mere conjurors.
So if we are going to challenge areas of mathematics that are so well trod, we can not afford to be wrong.
I need you to attend your lectures, do n't offend your professors, and keep doing your proofs, otherwise this experiment of ours will be doomed to failure.
There are many ways to be honored in life.
For us, being elected a Fellow is certainly one, but in my humble opinion
to leave a legacy, here at the Wren after we're gone is the greatest.
This library houses the Epistles of Saint Paul, the poems of Milton,
But in my estimation, as a man of numbers, the pièce de résistance is Newton's Principia Mathematica.
Now, just as Newton represents the physical aspect of our work, your notebooks represent the abstract.
T ook a long time for Newton to be proved.
Which is why we have an obligation to prove these.
Now, do you understand what's at stake here?
I hope you are taking care of yourself and that Mr. Hardy is good to you.
Everyone here is so proud of you.
But most proud of all is me.
I spend every day missing you, and waiting for your letter to tell me I'm coming to be with you across the ocean.
You are my everything.
I've discovered a new series.
Look, I'm not interested in a new series.
I thought I'd explained this.
I need your proofs.
Because it is written.
Written where, Ramanujan?
Now, take my coat, go home and get properly dressed before you freeze.
Sir, I've come a very long way to be here.
And you promised to help me publish.
Do n't look at me like that.
It's for his own good.
You would n't think he's so bloody smart by the way he dresses.
P of 4 equals 5.
Now, all that means is there are five ways to add up the number 4.
2 + 2, and 4.
But when you raise the number of P to 100, there are 204,226 different combinations.
Major MacMahon did it by hand.
And now he thinks he can figure out a formula.
Plug in the number, any number, and out comes the number of partitions.
I take it you have tried to crack this one before?
It's considered impossible.
A bloody rabbit hole mystery of the universe.
Using the divergence theorem, what is the flux of F through S here?
What on earth's he doing?
You should let him run, Hardy.
You should n't stifle him.
He's gone to the cricket.
Just, uh, follow the umbrella.
Oh, I've been over those proofs of yours, if you can call them that, very carefully.
And I've marked where you're missing steps and where you've made mistakes.
There's much more I could say, but that's where you should begin.
Listen, I'm hard on you for your own benefit.
So that you can be published.
But, sir, you can publish the notebooks and my prime number theorem.
You've had them since I arrived.
There is nothing I'd like more.
But, if I was to publish them in their present state, I'd be sent to the lunatic asylum.
These steps you want, what you want, I do not know how to do.
Well, you can just begin by trying your best and see if you do n't surprise yourself.
Sir, do you know something I do n't?
Oh, no, God and I do n't see exactly eye to eye.
So if I prepare for rain, then it wo n't.
So far, so good.
I'm Hardy and I'm spending the afternoon in the Wren Library.
Now we're sure to have sunshine.
You see, I'm what you call an atheist.
You believe in God.
You just do n't think He likes you.
Give you this just yet, but I took the liberty of doing some of your proofs myself.
Just to show you what together we can achieve.
You've been published.
Mr. Hardy, thank you!
It is with great pride that today all of us have shared the publication of my son's article in the London Mathematical Society.
Such a big thing.
A very prestigious society.
So how really is the little genius?
Do n't pay attention to her.
She's not proud enough of his achievements.
It just came over the wire.
- No, silly, Belgium.
The King's arriving!
Bertie's asked me to help him with his Union of Democratic Control or something.
Hmm, agitating already?
Well, I received a letter from the War Office this morning.
Seems they need some assistance with ballistics.
I did try to explain, but they're rather a dense lot.
- Anyway, you probably wo n't miss me.
There's an ongoing theory that I'm merely a figment of your imagination.
Ah, Ramanujan's out there.
There's a reason he does n't like proofs, you know.
Well, I've been having some reservations about some of his work.
Well, what did you expect?
He may belong to a world beyond us, but he's not God.
Well, that's a relief.
How will Janaki ever come now?
They say it'll be over by Christmas.
Please finish by telling him that, of course, I will come and not to worry about the war.
It is far away from here.
And that I will wait for him to make the necessary arrangements.
Also that I love him very much.
Make your mark here.
I knew your husband.
He's still there in the alcove.
Amma, please, would you post this for him?
He needs to know I will still come with the war.
Amma, please let me help you.
Where are all the vegetables?
There is no letter for you.
Please, can you check again?
I already looked again.
Now, you're holding up the queue.
His mum forgot to write him.
Look who it is, the genius wog!
Can you believe they send us off while he kips here in luxury?
Where do you think you're going?
You freeloading little blackie.
I'm talking to you.
Do n't you forget it.
Victory at any price?
I understand it's inevitable that anybody primarily interested in peace should be unpopular in a time of war.
But perhaps that is all the more reason that we should exist.
Mr. Littlewood has very kindly offered us his rooms while he is away solving the intricacies of ballistics for which he is so ill - suited.
So please keep your hands off my books.
By that he means his whiskey collection.
Thank you all very much for coming.
were so fast and ours were in completely the wrong position.
What is the meaning of this?
I'd have thought you'd choose your battles more wisely.
You should know that your friend,
Russell, is going to lose his lectureship as a result of the leaflets he's been distributing.
We have heard that others are doing the same.
Are you threatening me?
Mr. Howard is simply trying to enlighten you as to the precariousness of your situation.
Well, rest assured, I shall, on principle.
Well, that's a rather dangerous word, with all your liberal colleagues in France.
That's what you wanted.
Now you get used to it.
From Mr. Littlewood, sir.
If I may, he's so misplaced on a battlefield, I should n't think a bullet would recognize him as a target.
Damn you, Littlewood.
My dear Harold, please forgive this personal transgression.
I'm gone now to this god - awful war and haven't the faintest idea if I will ever return.
Fortunately, unlike you, I do have God to take comfort in.
I have two points to make.
The first is that Ramanujan's work on primes, while brilliant in itself, is actually wrong.
The other point is less straightforward.
The man exceeds any notion of brilliance that I have ever understood.
Forget Jacobi, we can compare him with Newton.
I have come to believe that for Ramanujan, every single positive integer is one of his personal friends.
And, to that end, you, too, have a responsibility.
You have to look after him and make sure that his work amounts to something.
Do n't let Howard and his lot win.
So, you see, Hardy, you, too, have a war to fight.
So, there you have it.
He left this for you to see for yourself.
Your theorem on primes is wrong.
It's rather interesting, really.
If you compare the prime number approximation with the actual number of primes, the calculation tells us what?
It always moves higher.
I gave it to you.
No, because however intuitively obvious it may seem, when subject to calculation, it fails.
Mr. Littlewood has calculated a number and it shows that your theorem will sometimes predict less, not more, than the actual number of primes.
Your theorem is wrong.
And this is why we can not publish anymore until you finally trust me on this business of proofs.
Intuition can only carry you so far.
I ca n't hear this anymore.
You say this word as if it is nothing.
Is that all it is to you?
All that I am?
I'm missing something.
You've never even seen me, let alone know me.
You are a man of no faith!
I do n't see pictures of anyone here!
Who are you, Mr. Hardy?
How dare you judge me?
But it is you who does of me!
Quite frankly, I do n't!
Do n't you know what I've given up to be here?
Do you even see the bruises on my face?
I have a wife, Mr. Hardy.
You're not well?
I'm just off to the Wren.
Believe it or not, if you can find your way round the beds, there are still some books there.
Those proofs you left...
So, we start work again?
I'm very sorry, sir.
He was a fine young man.
Best of his year.
They were all fine young men.
All the knowledge they gained here.
Sacrificed for a few yards of land.
They say it's the price of victory.
I'm worried about Ramanujan.
Well, he does n't seem quite himself.
Very little, I admit.
But I do n't think he's well.
He seems to have changed.
We had a terrible row the other night about intuition, of all things, and he stormed out.
And then a day later he produces these wonderful proofs.
Well, Harold, you've got your way.
You and your damned rigor has finally broken his spirits.
Well, I suppose a horse is n't a bad place to start.
Major, can I have a word?
I do n't have time for you!
He wo n't be able to do it without you.
He wo n't be able to do it at all.
I've been going over your work on partitions.
Seems to me you're on the verge of a major breakthrough.
So now you've begun to embrace some proper rigor...
I think you should meet Major MacMahon.
Also happens to be one of your most vocal opponents.
He says partitions ca n't be done.
Especially by the likes of you.
Enter at your own risk!
I've been waiting for you.
Yes, child's play.
Combinatorics, that's what I do.
Bloody nerve of you both.
You fail on primes, then you think you can just turn round and crack partitions?
Ca n't be done, I'm telling you.
Especially not by you.
No, I will.
By slow and painful addition, and then you can be absolutely certain that whatever formula you two can dream up will be quite wrong.
Then you can crawl back under whatever rock you came from in India and we can put to bed this charade of yours, Hardy.
Now, how high do I have to go?
P of 200 should do.
I really can do it.
You know, I was stationed in Madras once.
Well, you first.
What has your formula given you?
Well, I'll be damned.
Major MacMahon, may I introduce you to Mr. Ramanujan.
You've all the early signs of tubercula.
You're a breeding ground for infection.
I'm so sorry, Ramanujan.
Hardy can never know.
Come on, Ram!
I'm being punished.
It's just the fever.
Has he wrote yet?
You see, you were right.
Cauchy's theorem will work.
It's just leading to the circle concept.
Less than 1% or so.
You're beginning to see the nuances and complexities, which you were only catching at a glance before.
What an unlikely team we make.
If we really crack partitions, this will be a monumental breakthrough.
Did I tell you I've...
Mr. Hardy, thank you.
Are you getting enough to eat?
I mean, I know there are shortages, but there's still plenty of good grub in Hall.
How does all this come to you?
Why am I bothering with a Council meeting when I'm getting the boot?
If you think I'm gonna have that charlatan for a Fellow, you're very much mistaken.
Oh, please tell me you did n't propose him.
- He's gonna crack partitions.
You're the one who told me to let him run like a damn horse.
Well, I did.
You mean you need to relieve your own guilt.
Really, for someone so clever, you can be so terribly dim.
I'm sorry to bother you so late.
I felt I should be the one to tell you.
I'm very embarrassed, for myself and for the College.
I know you did all you could.
Yeah, more dressings!
Can we have someone over here, please?
That's it, just breathe.
Shall I wake him?
He'll come when he's ready.
Excuse me, Doctor.
This gentleman's looking for the Indian student.
He came in last night.
Not right in the head.
Your condition has worsened.
You may not have long.
You should set your affairs in order.
Do you have any family here?
Sir, something's happened in London.
Call me a taxi, will you?
He was very lucky with the train.
Yes, he's had a bad cough for some time.
He has advanced tuberculosis.
Is there nothing we could do?
It will take a miracle.
I'm sorry for the trouble I've caused you.
Gave me quite a scare.
My wife has forgotten me.
I have no one.
You should have told me.
I could have helped.
You know, it just as easily could have been me.
Well, I'm glad it was n't.
You have cause enough with Ramanujan.
I'll be thinking of you both.
And I'll wait for them to beg to have me back here.
Too bad he could n't take Hardy with him.
I still do n't see what he bloody contributes.
It seems that Ramanujan's on the verge of a major breakthrough.
Oh, that's impossible.
Remains to be seen.
God, it's freezing in here.
Are you warm enough?
I have to go to that pipe just so I do n't freeze.
It would have been better for all had the train done it s job.
Oh, yeah, you could have been reincarnated as a pigeon turd.
Sorry I've not been able to be a better friend to you in the traditional sense.
I know you've needed one, but I'm not very good at all of that.
You wanted to know how I get my ideas.
She speaks to me.
Puts formulas on my tongue when I sleep, sometimes when I pray.
Because if you are my friend, then you will know that I'm telling you the truth.
If you are truly my friend.
But I do n't believe in God. I do n't believe in anything I ca n't prove.
Then you ca n't believe in me.
Do n't you see?
An equation has no meaning to me unless it expresses a thought of God.
Maybe it is better that we just remain what we were.
When I was at school, I remember one of my chaplains saying,
You know God exists because He's like a kite,
"and you can feel the tug on the string and know that He's up there."
I said, "What if there's no wind and the kite ca n't fly?"
I ca n't believe in God.
I do n't believe in the immemorial wisdom of the East, but I do believe in you.
I very much want to finish what we started.
I brought some calculations in case you were feeling a bit better.
And then I want to go home.
As soon as I am able.
Or if I should die, you have to promise that you will get me home.
Oh, this came for you.
I'll leave you in peace.
Try and do what the doctors ask.
I know it's not in your nature.
I will never know why you have chosen to forsake me.
Just a letter in response to the multitude I have sent you would have been enough.
I have gone to be with my brother and his family where I will remain.
This last letter is to say good - bye.
He's a terrible patient.
Does n't believe in medicine.
Wo n't eat anything.
Just prays to his Namagiri.
Well, I'd be praying too if you were my doctor.
And I'm a bloody atheist.
This ca n't die with me, Mr. Hardy.
If this is correct, you'll make a difference.
I have the proofs.
He really did it.
Now he must be a Fellow.
Oh, be practical, Hardy.
He'll only fail again.
Not with your help, he wo n't.
Besides, there is another way.
If he had a Royal Fellowship...
MacMahon, listen to me.
He really needs this.
See that this gets to Lieutenant Littlewood.
Mr. Hobson, Mr. Baker, I have someone who wishes to talk to you about Mr. Ramanujan.
I just want the opportunity to make the case.
But I think you'll find the result will be the same.
Now what have you got yourself involved with?
Good of you to come.
So, now we see the work on partitions and the enormous breakthrough that has been achieved.
All this, mind you, by a man whose limitations of knowledge when I met him were as startling as was its profundity.
Opinions may differ as to the importance of Ramanujan's work and the influence it may or may not have on the mathematics of the future, but one gift it does show is its profound and invincible originality.
Mr. Littlewood once told me that "every positive integer is one of Ramanujan's personal friends."
I believe this to be true.
He told me that an equation for him had no meaning unless it expressed a thought of God.
Well, despite everything in my being set to the contrary, perhaps he is right.
For is this not exactly our justification for pure mathematics?
We are merely explorers of infinity in the pursuit of absolute perfection.
We do not invent these formulae, they already exist and lie in wait for only the very brightest of minds, like Ramanujan, ever to divine and prove.
It's bad enough that this charlatan has wasted our time once.
No, enough is enough with this.
Littlewood is not the only one.
I think he has the finest mind I've seen in my lifetime.
And his name is Ramanujan.
I'm a Fellow of the Royal Society.
He wrote to me.
If you had gone to him, he would never return.
Are you really gonna go home?
Well, as a Fellow of the Royal Society, they're gonna be really proud of you.
- I owe you so much.
It's I who owe you.
Come on the grass.
But, sir, I ca n't.
I'm not a Fellow over here.
Well, as an FRS, what could they say?
"I, Srinivas Ramanujan,
"elected Fellow of Trinity College..."
I, Srinivas Ramanujan, elected Fellow of Trinity College.
Sorry I'm late. Bloody cab driver got lost.
Should have known from his number.
It is a very interesting number.
It is the smallest number expressible as the sum of two cubes in two different ways.
Have you notified your family?
I do n't even know if she got my letter.
But I will say this.
There are no proofs nor underlying laws that can determine the outcome of matters of the heart.
Of this I'm sure.
Perhaps when we meet again you will have such matters of your own.
I will miss you, my friend.
I will miss you.
So, I want a letter with you with all your new work, every week.
And come back to us in a year's time.
Afternoon post, sir.
His originality has been a constant source of suggestion to me ever since I first met him.
And his death is one of the worst blows I have ever felt.
But now I say to myself when I'm depressed, and I find myself forced to listen to tiresome and pompous people,
"Well, I've done something you could never have done.
"I have collaborated with both Littlewood and Ramanujan
"on something like equal terms."
Let's take this one.
I do n't see what's so special about this one.
Neither did I at first.
I have something for you.
You are still in pain.
It is Chinese medicine.
You and Ragnar need my warriors.
- Destroy those Christian folk.
Have you ever met Harbard?
No, not I.
Perhaps your mother has.
I do n't ever want to forget how you looked on our wedding day, Earl Kalf is dead.
You are the boat builder that helped make Ragnar so famous.
Why would he fall out with someone like you?
If we were to lose Paris, we would lose everything.
This is Earl Kalf's grave? May I ask why you killed him?
I made a promise.
I promised I'd kill him for taking my earldom.
I suppose you would want to leave, now that Earl Kalf is dead.
I wish to return to Paris, with you and Ragnar, come here, Guthrum.
I will be leaving soon.
I advise you to keep your friends very close, for some of them will die only too soon.
The others will betray you.
I want to announce that we leave for Paris in three weeks to the day. But today is today, and we are here to perform an important ceremony, in which my two boys, Ubbe and Hvitserk,
will receive their sacred arm rings.
Take this offering of earth and salt to remind you that you belong both to the earth and to the sea. These arm rings symbolize your coming of age.
They also bind you in loyalty and fealty to me, your king and your father.
Any oath you swear upon these rings must be kept, or else you will sacrifice your honor and your place in Valhalla.
- Do you swear so?
Put on your rings, my brothers! Come here.
I'm taking the boys with me to Paris.
It is my decision, if they come or not, and they are not too young to watch.
In any case, they're safer with me than they were the last time with you, as I remember.
I have summoned you together because I have made an important decision.
I have decided to send my grandson, Prince Alfred, on a pilgrimage to Rome, so that he might see the holy city and meet His Holiness the Pope.
Now, some of you may ask, why send Alfred and not his older brother?
And my answer to you is this.
We all know the circumstances of Alfred's birth.
It was my belief then, and it is still my belief, that Alfred has been chosen by God for great things.
This journey will be a preparation for whatever great future our Lord has designed for him.
I wish, Father, that you had first discussed this matter with me.
The road to Rome is filled with untold dangers.
But who will lead our armies against Mercia and place its rightful queen at her throne?
Oh, be not afraid of that.
I personally will lead our armies in that venture. How long would it take to walk to Rome?
Your Highness, we will walk for about 12 miles a day, and the whole journey is 1,100 miles.
Only your feet will be tired, Your Highness, but at the end of the journey, your soul will be filled with joy and happiness.
You do n't have to dole it out to me like I'm a child.
But you are a child when it comes to this stuff, and someone needs to control what, apparently, you can not.
Then how will I get it when I'm in Paris?
Take me with you. I want to go.
I do n't want to stay here.
You said I can do as I please, but you keep me here like one of your rats in a cage.
No. It's the only way you can get your medicine.
And you may need me for other things as well.
Let me ask you a question.
You will die on the day that the blind man sees you.
Do n't lie to me.
I feel among friends.
That's because you are among friends, my dear Floki.
You and us, we're the same. I feel it in my heart's core.
But, uh, tell us honestly, would n't you rather be traveling with Ragnar?
I'm here with my new friends. Who love the gods as much as I do.
And would never betray them.
That ring again. I do n't understand.
Where did you find it?
I took it from a berserker who was sent to kill me.
Now do you see? Sigurd, what is it?
You have no one to play with, so play with your brother's daughter, Siggy.
Do you want to go outside? You're so dirty.
Do n't you ever wash?
Mother! Do n't be frightened. Keep looking!
We were blown off - course. We have to head south.
Boys, eyes out for the others. Amen.
May God in his grace keep you and console you on your long journey, and may you enjoy it s many fruits.
You know, when you are dirty, you have a bath to wipe off the dirt.
It wipes away the dirt from the soul.
Farewell, my boy. My boy.
Do as your father says.
And Father Prudentius. They know best.
The first step is always the hardest. Look there!
Who else could it be?
Why have you come back?
I know how you suffer.
I know all your pain.
The things you can not tell anyone else.
Come to me and I will put an end to your suffering and heal you and make you free.
- Why are we doing this, Father?
- You'll see it.
Your son is healthy and well.
I have no doubt that the gods have great things in store for him.
Why do you ask her?
And I'm nothing to you?
We still have much in common.
I do n't care about your feelings for Bjorn, because if I ask you to kill him, you will have to do it.
Otherwise I will kill the boy.
And believe me, Lagertha ca n't protect your son.
You thought you were free, Torvi. Free to choose Bjorn over me? But you never were.
News of our arrival will soon reach Paris.
- Taking them for a walk.
He tortured me and shamed me.
How is he my friend?
He spared your life.
Help me understand why you are here fighting instead of trying to keep your baby safe.
You've never spoken to me about Kalf's death.
Must've broken your heart.
I still do n't understand why you are willing to risk your baby's life in battle.
You'll give Christians a bad name.
- Help them, brother, help them.
A signal from the gods!
Do you think they can see it?
Do you think they can understand it? The Northmen have returned, and it is said they fly the black raven banner of King Ragnar Lothbrok.
We have planned for this day.
His Grace and I will now lead our forces to the two forts we have built downriver.
And from these forts, we will defend the city, if necessary, to the death.
We are ready for the heathen.
Your Grace, you are the difference between failure and triumph.
With your help, we can frustrate and defeat the enemy.
I beg and beseech you.
I would beg you, for all we have given you,
do not return to your brother.
I will not betray you.
I will not betray Paris. And I will not betray my wife. Of course he will betray us if he can.
Paris must never be left to the mercies of a pagan.
I thought he had become a Christian. Do you really believe that?
Personally, I do n't think so.
When Ragnar appears, when his brother appears, is it not likely that our Duke Rollo will embrace him?
Do n't you think they might have already planned these things?
I thought you needed him to fight with you.
He was useful to us early on.
I would've got rid of him subsequently.
You see, these are precisely the decisions an emperor must make if he wishes to keep his throne. Are you ready for me to undress?
No, not tonight.
I will chain you up, just as you are.
If that is your will. You are treated very badly.
The Emperor fawns upon the Northman.
He should trust you more.
He should trust me above the Northman.
He's an idiot.
I have lost all faith.
What will you do? Do I have your permission?
- And then I will organize a coup against the Emperor.
I will have him killed and I will replace him.
You will be the Emperor?
Yes, I will be the Emperor.
Does that surprise you? Ivar.
You remember Harbard, do n't you?
Blessed Ivar. Halt!
Is that not Rollo?
You know very well.
Say it in italian!
Huge is my emotion to see the beautiful, clever, young, enter our big famille, who always loved women as we loved Poësie, and sang love as if it was a music
I wanna speak with mister Fox, please.
Oh, that's you Karine!
It does n't matter, I need urgently to talk to him!
- May he call you back?
- Because I do n't have the number of this place!
I'm in an hotel, I have left Vittorio!
- Half an hour ago!
It's all over!
But sir, do n't you take the lift?
Nelly, it's me, open the door!
I know you're here!
What's the trouble with you now?!
What have I done?
- Have you gone insane!?
What are you doing here!
I do n't want to marry you!
- I gonna call the police!
- Take him by his legs!
- So you're french?
What's the problem with him!
- Please let me go, he's crazy, let me go!
He wants to kill me!
That's nothing, stay in bed!
- Where is she!
I have to go and leave Venzuela, do you understand?
I just do n't carry millions in my pockets after midnight
You know I do n't refuse to lend you
I do n't ask you to lend me!
I ask you to pay me!
My 2000 dollars, you've owned me that for a year!
Did n't we say, 400 $per month?
September, October, November, and the double pay month of December?
Ca n't you count now?
Yes, now that's all I remember!
- Not tomorrow but right away!
Go and take some in the cash desk!
In front of the cashier?
- She's my partner's wife
What do you mean about my work permit?
But I never had a work permit.
You're a foreigner, what more can I say to you
I did n't make the laws.
OK, that's enough, now I call your wife!
Could you come down please?
Do n't move from here, I'll go.
What will you tell him?
It's a Lautrec.
Take a look, it's written here!
Do you know it s value?
Do you think this is not the original?
OK, take a closer look at that!
This is the authenticity certificate, ca n't your read!
So how much do you have?
But why have you come to me?
That's not enough.
If it's not enough, go beg in other rooms! Cause I wake up at 7, and I need some sleep!
It's seven o clock!
- You're still here?
Where do you want to go?
That's far from here.
That's the reason it's expensive!
I know some guy at the airport.
I should rather say, a friend.
- And he can lend me some money?
Let's leave right now!
We'll have some at the airport!
- But if there is no plane for France today?
What are you doing in that country?
And you came that far to garden?
- Wait for me!
Get down right now!
- Who's that one now?
- Do n't you mind him!
We wo n't run this way til christmas!
- OK I had enough, I stop now!
- Stop the engine!
- Have you gone totally nuts?
No, it's alright, nothing has broken.
Very clever, I just bought it yesterday!
Take that rope please.
- You're doing the cooking?
- How does it work?
I was better with Alex, but I was only "another girl".
Alex, is he the painting guy?
He's the one that brought me here, I met him in London.
What will you do in France?
I can go to my father's.
So you never got married?
- What happened to him?
- Because I asked him
But do n't forget to pay, cause I'll remain as hostage.
- We are nothing one to the other!
- Will you shut up!
The plane has been warned.
Thank you so much!
Could you move back your car cause?
- What will she do in Paris?
But he's bleeding!
At the end of the month.
Drink something at least!
He asks me to pay the call!
And this guy owe me everything!
Did n't you fly away?
No I could n't!
Go and check, look at the signature!
It's a copy!
That's all I got with me!
Of course, if you'd been here, you could have done something.
But when he showed me where the island was.
What nonsense are you telling me!
How did you pay him?
- Your ticket to France?
- That's enough!
I have no time for that!
I did n't spend 2 days on a boat to hear your circus way of life!
When you wake up, gimme a call! And then we'll decide!
No we wo n't!
Where do you go?
I have an affair to offer you.
Would you mind taking me to St Domingue?
I knew a guy over there.
- And with that money.
Do you know where St Domingue is?
We'll owe nothing more one to the other!
Just tell me your price!
We could share if you wish, well.
You want me to leave?
I do n't know, there are no fisher boats coming here sometimes?
What's in it?
How many are they?
So you planted all of these?
- How much do you sell them?
Pick up some tomatoes!
Are you alone on this island?
Tomorrow, I can cook a pumpkin with pepper.
Do you own the house?
- No I rent it.
But how long have you been here?
It's been two years now, I rented it for 99 years.
After, I'll see, I'll keep you informed!
Where were you before?
Does it have bad taste?
It turned a little acid.
I found a vineyard in the hill, this year I made 22 litres.
Not acid at all!
- Yes, almost!
Do n't sit down we're leaving.
- Off the island, with the tide.
Why did n't you say it!?
You know what we'll do at St Domingue?
A big party, I'll invite you!
Listen, I ca n't take you to St Domingue.
So where do we go?
- I take you back.
I did n't do all that to go back!
OK, then I stay here!
- You mean here?
I am well here because I'm on my own!
Now, get on the boat, I have plenty of things to do And all that is wasted time for me!
Let me stay here please.
Do you hear me!
I'm fed up with that!
"An Oscar for french perfumes"
Will you cut that out!
But no stealing, just ask me!
I'll give her St Domingue.
The brunette on the picture in the drawer, is she your wife?
Correct me if I'm wrong!
Where is your shop?
It'll be nothing.
Near Cannes, in the hill side.
Awful not to know such a thing!
Everybody there work for the perfume industry.
When I was a kid, with my brother, we were apprentices at the distillery.
Every day, we picked violets.
Was n't very hard job to do.
Not hard but you have to get up at four in the morning, they have to be picked before the sun appears.
And when there are no more violets?
Then you can use chemistry.
What is "Solo"?
Why do you laugh?
"College", the one with the bottle looking like an inkpot?
- I used some when I was in Spain.
- What did you think about?
Price was not my job!
I read on a newspaper, they say you're very good!
What is the name of your firm?
So the brunette in the drawer, she's your wife?
- She's american?
Was she in love with you?
Sanders ai n't your real name, huh?
No, I changed it.
When you change your life if you want to be left alone you must change your name too.
And you loved her?
How long did you work for the Police?
So what happened exactly?
I do n't know exactly.
Everything was going fine
What did you tell them?
Not to anyone?
I take you to st Domingue!
The closest is La Gueira and it quite far from here!
We might end sailing!
Then, you'll just have to take a plane.
So we wo n't see each other then.
There is fresh coffee in the kitchen.
I want to stay with you.
- Why "bastard"?
- And the kids?
- You mean the grandchildren!
They are in Genève with their parents.
And he is still ignorant yet?
Whom does he pay his rent to?
To the former owners.
Did you never felt like going and take him back?
He might go farer than that! That would cost us more money!
You're absolutely sure he'll come back?
- What is he doing?
Selling his fruits and vegetables.
Do n't you agree?
Buying him all the Pacific ocean or the Atlantic will not make him come back!
Then go fetch him with a gun my dear!
I just have to call our lawyers!
Do you what is that?
The 27 contracts he signed before making off!
Who's gonna pay?
The Japanese has built 4 factories to make perfumes which remain in his mind!
Personnaly, I do n't speak japanese.
No, I lost time because of the flu.
Did you catch the flu?
I visited you wednesday, but you ai n't at your place.
- What was the time?
- It was 4 or 5.
So when do we leave?
I do n't know, when we wish to.
I'm gonna pack my things.
A quarter to eight?
- Why a quarter?
Martin, there is only me around!
No, it only works between the house and your place!
Could you call me back please, I ca n't speak to you straight away!
Or I'll call you back, just give me your number.
There is no number, just pull the crank.
It's the last night.
Listen, tonight's gonna be impossible I have plenty of things to do.
We'll keep in touch!
- What am I saying!
- Come on, we never see each other.
I do n't care that much, but you know the cooking.
- What is the problem?
No, and how about you?
Listen, are you kidding me or what?
Now it's raining.
I'm hungry, we'll go and dine, huh?
Well, I did n't notice.
Of course, you see nothing!
You'll have to change your glasses!
Now it's too late!
What's too late!
- That's no more the time!
- I would have loved them!
There, a man, there!
She's there in a house.
- We're leaving, get dressed!
Everybody's waiting for you!
Your Martin has ran like a rabbit to the mountains.
What are you looking at!
- Nobody knew I was here.
Yes the aviator, he ran to me!
- The one who brought you here!
Where is the painting?
- Cut it out and leave us alone!
I'll sue her!
It's a pleasure!
- She's not with you?
Well you know, we got married, but it did n't worked.
- I'm coming honey!
She's a beauty, no?
She's horny but maybe I get married again.
So, the first who sees Nelly waves hello for the other!
But you do n't know, well, where she is?
I think she was in Mexico, All the time moving, you know her!
- Mister Sander - Coutances is that you?
Allegedly responsible for over 200 murders Cesare has yet to spend one day behind bars.
Do I fix your makeup for you?
Well, he might come out tonight.
As a matter of fact,
I'm pretty sure he's gonna show up.
I'm gonna bring him in.
You know, you kill me, Soap.
Let's just say if you can make this happen, why would you?
He does to those bastards what me and you can only fantasize about.
Sure thing, Pops.
Look, you know, it's just, uh
Take it easy in there, okay?
Nicky, what am I gonna do?
Give the old guy a heart attack?
You handled the witness situation perfectly.
No sweat, Uncle G.
Hey, saves you a trip to the can, right?
You came to discuss a private matter.
Down at the docks!
Cristu's bringing in a shipment.
He needs a safe port.
I've arranged for my customs guy, Simmons, to be on that night.
We wo n't break a sweat.
Some kind of biological package.
Probably going up to the ragheads in Queens.
Cristu guaranteed it's leaving the city.
In case your memory's going along with your bodily functions you might like to remember I'm the top earner here.
I should have had the both of you locked away.
One more word about my brother, I swear to Christ I'll.
Hey, let's just all calm down here, okay?
I put out a big spread out here, so come on, boys, eat up.
All right, let's split up.
Well, should n't we wait for backup?
Listen, Billy Russoti's getting away.
And where the hell were you, huh?
I knew he would come.
Hey, let me get your statement.
Come on, Saffiotti, tell me everything.
I asked him to come.
These are couple of my colleagues.
No mountain too high, no river too deep.
All right, all right, all right, enough.
Pittsy, get me some money.
Time to go to work.
Running a little low, boss.
We just picked up 200K from the Lucciano construction site.
I had to launder it through the Pussycat Lounge.
Like you told me, remember?
Well, bring it back. Tomorrow.
You got it, boss.
That's 20 rolls of hundreds.
That's a grand each, all counted.
I'll check it out, boss.
You get the guards.
Come on, Castle!
You two, up the stairs.
Team 1, on me.
We got a live one!
The Lord is compassion and love.
Slow to anger and rich in mercy.
He does not treat us according to our sins, nor repay us according to our faults.
As parents have compassion on their children, the Lord has pity on those who fear him.
For he knows of what we are made, he remembers that we are dust.
As for us, our days are like grass.
We flower like the flower of the field.
The wind blows and we are gone, and our place never sees us again.
I'm so sorry for your loss.
It was n't anybody's fault.
He said something big was gonna happen.
He asked for Homeland Security.
We've been running 24 - hour surveillance on Russoti.
And just as we were about to find out what is happening,
Because we have a real national security threat. And the last time I checked, that tops trying to nab some crazed vigilante.
I'm gonna get this guy, Angie.
I heard the bureau was sending a babysitter.
Thirty years on the force.
I still do n't know what that word means.
We have a certain way of doing things around here, Special Agent Budiansky.
Four years this Punisher's been wreaking havoc.
And you have n't once caught a break.
Your buddies from the bureau told me the city is under some kind of terror threat.
New Yorkers are a bit sensitive about that, if you know what I mean.
I've got all my men trying to find out what your late colleague came across when he went under.
Maybe if you feds allowed us lowly cops in on your undercover operations once in a while, all of this could have been avoided.
In a pool of his own blood?
Captain, you know what?
Did I get that right?
The captain told me you were coming in.
Welcome to The Punisher Task Force.
I'm Detective Martin Soap.
You have a degree in Behavioral Psychology?
So, what do you actually do here?
This is ground zero.
I've shadowed his every step for the last five years.
I've documented every murder that fit his profile, and I've collected intelligence on all known associates.
Take a look at this.
Frank Castle was a Special Forces instructor.
One day, he takes his wife and kids for a picnic, and by chance o- or fate, depending on which you believe in, they witnessed a mob execution.
When they were discovered.
And since then, he's been taking down one crime family after another.
I'm really close, Budiansky.
Only thing getting in my way is some bad luck.
You know, I've been waiting for someone like you.
Take a look at some of the case files.
I'll get us a pie from Milano's.
Best pizza in the city.
The alleged Punisher murders.
All of 'em.
What do you want, Micro?
I'm posing as a one - armed Wahhabi warrior who took a crap in a cave next to Bin Laden.
I think I can score you a couple of rocket launchers.
Have n't seen you in a while.
It's gun show season in Virginia.
No background checks, no problems.
That's too much, Frank.
Call it a retirement package.
We all make mistakes, Frank.
You're fighting a war against the assholes who slip through the raindrops, who get away with it.
In any war, there's collateral damage.
I killed an agent in the field.
One of the good guys.
He had a family.
Now, please. Just leave me alone.
We already went to his place and tore it apart.
No sign of a safety deposit key or nothing.
Does he got any next of kin?
Somebody that carry on the family name?
Papers said something about a wife and a little girl.
Let's look there.
Am I glad to see you.
How the heck did you end up at a free clinic?
Insurance said I missed a payment.
Um, look, before we do this,
You should n't have been able to survive this.
Well, that's why I'm here, doc.
I have the best plastic surgeon in all of New York.
Your facial muscles, tendons, bone structure, everything, was destroyed.
Just take it off already.
Okay. Uh, let's do this.
I need to talk to my doctor alone.
You ca n't control yourself?
You know how sensitive he is about his looks.
Much better. Thanks.
We need to focus on my goals.
One, we need to get my money back.
But he took out, like, 30 of us.
How are we gonna kill him before he'll kill us?
My brother will take care of that.
His name is James.
It's a good idea. Really, it is.
Do n't mind him.
He does n't think before he talks, just like his mother.
From now on, you call me Jigsaw.
How are we doing today, Loony Bin Jim?
Dr. Basner, open up.
Ink, cut these off, now.
Pittsy, go open the doors of every other cell, lead everybody out the front door.
I'll take care of this guy.
Oh, no, brother.
I'm gonna get my applesauce back.
Kidneys and applesauce are a delicacy in Sweden?
Uh, what do you say, boss?
Well, uh, in case he starts, you know, not feeling so good.
I think he's doing just great.
You're in my light.
For the next time someone gets in your light.
Mom, that's a Dad word.
You're messing with the wrong family on the wrong day, asshole.
What makes you think you could come here?
You'll scare the girl.
I said shut up.
You do n't get to shoot my husband in cold blood and then stop at the ATM.
It's for your daughter.
This is what you deserve.
He taught you how to shoot.
A good age nt keeps his family safe, but he could n't always be here.
He showed you what to do.
This is where you do it.
I ca n't find my red pen.
Mom, I need it.
Is this it, boss?
Old Cesare used to rent it to screw hookers.
What's the matter, Billy?
What has he done to me?
One, I will find Castle and I will kill him slowly and painfully.
You're not in Transylvania anymore, Cristu.
We do n't talk vampire.
My man is concerned.
If Punisher can do this to your face, what might he do to our deal?
The tongue stretches further than most people think.
The Punisher is not a problem.
The docks are mine.
My looks have nothing to do with this.
Everybody, from the local security to international customs, is in my pocket.
Quite frankly, this job does n't get done without me.
My most sincere apologies.
My father'd always say never insult your host.
You do n't know of my father.
It has to be 12 million.
You're selling it to the ragheads in Queens.
Gon na take a lot of payola to keep it quiet.
Always knew you'd be a good boss, Billy.
Let him go, Frank.
He's a regular choirboy.
You know how the cops are running those gun buy - backs?
Except they never work.
Because what banger is gonna trust a cop, right?
Well, these drive - by wack jobs, they just love Carlos here.
They get one look at that ink and they know he's for real.
Never once seen a banger that could quit.
He's straight, Frank.
Hey, Mom, Frank's here.
He says eat up, huh?
How's she doing?
As long as she's got her cooking shows, she's good.
It's the only thing she notices.
But, hey, that's something, right?
I just came around to tell you that I'm going out of town for a while.
I never thought of, uh, The Punisher you know, taking a long weekend.
I'm not planning on coming back.
So I take it things did n't go so well at the Donatelli home?
Are you aware that Billy Russoti survived?
Let the cops take care of him.
You and I know they got nothing on him.
This is where The Punisher comes in.
This is why I believe in you, why I supported you all these years.
Cause that's what's gonna happen.
It's not a question of if, it's a matter of when.
Pull a couple of Berettas.
Russoti's the last one, then I'm done.
From your lips to God's ears.
You know where I can find him?
You wiped out his associates that are known to me.
I saw him with some new guys.
Leader was black, dreadlocks.
Did some acrobatic stuff over the roofs.
That's Maginty and his urban free - flow gang.
He's on a constant meth high.
You wanna find this guy or not?
You boys play nice.
I've been looking for you.
Agent Budiansky, take a load off.
I need to go see Castle.
Where do I find him?
You know what I like to do?
I like to sit in my car and listen to the CB radio and follow the crime.
We might just run into him.
It's never worked for me in five years, but I'm not the luckiest guy on the planet, you know?
Maginty and his boys are planning to hit a convenience store on 45th and 2nd.
Suspects are armed and dangerous.
I repeat, suspects are armed and dangerous.
He was supposed to give me some dough for a job.
So when did Donatelli go undercover?
Unfortunately, most of the blow we confiscated ended up in my nose.
Internal Affairs tried to get Nicky to rat me out.
He's dead because of me.
So you still skiing the old Alps?
Hello, Mrs. Donatelli.
Or will you be calling yourself "Miss" from now on?
I'm looking for my money which your rat of a husband stole from me.
But we do n't have it, I swear to God.
How about you, sweetcheeks?
Make sure they do n't move.
We'll look for the money.
Russoti is heading to the Donatelli house.
He's probably already there.
You have to let me go.
Is everything okay in there?
Everything is not okay.
Oh, no, you do n't.
Have you heard back from the patrol car?
Oh, I tried a couple of times.
My husband has a safe upstairs, in the bedroom.
I do n't know if it's there but I can give you the combination.
Oh, how cute.
Is that your dead husband's birthday?
Let me help you.
Get him to the station.
Now, you, sit down.
I'm calling this in.
Put your hands behind your back.
Where do you think you're going?
I repeat, request immediate backup.
We did it, Budiansky, huh?
Would you mind explaining to me how a handcuffed criminal escapes custody from the back of your locked car?
That Castle's a slippery one.
You'll be safe here.
We can manage on our own.
Grace, we're leaving soon, honey.
It belonged to my daughter.
Put that down, honey.
It was Lisa's favorite toy.
She got so angry when her little brother used to hide it from her.
Does she care if I play with it?
You're gonna fry for killing two of my officers, Billy.
Agent Miller, what are you doing here?
What's he got to do with the bureau?
The case Donatelli was working on.
He says he's got some intel, he wants to make a deal.
Anyone know where he is right now?
Just brought him into the observation room.
Captain Ross, Agent Miller from the bureau.
I believe you've been informed I'll be taking over this?
This perp killed two of my officers and terrorized the widow and child of one of your agents.
You keep that in mind, Miller.
You're lucky I came to you with this.
But then, I'm a patriot.
The reason you came to me is' cause you got caught.
So do n't insult my intelligence, okay?
You tell me what you know.
If it's any good,
I'll recommend life without parole.
This deal is going down tonight.
I know when and I know where.
There's just one other little thing.
The other condition of our agreement?
I hope to God he finds you and you get what you deserve.
Ooh. How long was I?
Egg and cheese MREs.
What's an MRE?
Look, Grace, this one came with Chuckles.
That's, um, the best one to get.
Not exactly a balanced breakfast.
His mother is n't feeling well.
He did n't want to leave her.
I need to talk to him.
He's gonna hang while I take care of some things.
I need you alert.
Do n't make me regret this.
Now, let's go kill Castle in his miserable hole.
Where do we get the army from?
Offer a hundred grand towards a college education they'll never get and promise nobody ever has to go to Iraq.
Do n't worry, brother, you will.
Just making damn sure this time he do n't come back breathing.
Hello, sports fans.
Get out of here!
I axed you a question.
Guess I'll have to ax it again.
Bring'em upstairs and meet me back down here.
Do n't die on me.
I'm bleeding out.
I've seen this show before.
Hurts real bad, Frank.
See you in hell.
I see you anywhere near hell, I'll kick your ass out.
Whatever it is, it must be pretty bad.
Maybe I'm just here to see an old friend, Mike.
I've been reading about you.
You've been a long a way from the seminary, my friend.
I do n't even remember that as part of my life.
Why do you do this?
Somebody has to punish the corrupt.
For in the same way you judge others, you will be judged.
And with the measure you use, it will be measured to you.
I'm okay with that.
God be with you, Frank.
Sometimes I'd like to get my hands on God.
Interesting choice for a meeting place.
I did n't take you for a religious man, Castle.
If I remember right, they're not called the Ten Suggestions.
Russoti's got Angela and Grace.
Well, maybe if you'd put'em in protective custody like you should have, we would n't be having this conversation.
The law ca n't touch him, Castle.
Unless you've got a videotape of Russoti taking them, we ca n't even give him a parking ticket.
Never said it was perfect.
He wants me in exchange for them.
I need you to secure the trade.
Okay, but I'm doing this by the book.
What book do you think they're going by?
I took an oath, Castle.
You wanna come along?
Leave your badge at home.
I have to think about it.
And we'd like to offer you the opportunity to be all that you can be.
Now, we've all suffered loss at the hands of The Punisher.
And because we do n't look like everybody else, and because we do n't act like everybody else, nobody does a goddamn thing about it.
You need to come with me.
Your partner, Frank Castle, needs help.
Partner is a little bit of an exaggeration.
Oh, usually, unless you've arrested Houdini, a handcuffed criminal does not escape that easily.
You know, you're not as stupid as you
I did n't say that.
Who are we looking for?
I do n't think this is a good idea.
We're looking for Tiberiu, Cristu's father.
If I were Tiberiu,
I'd probably wanna find the man who was responsible for sending my son to prison for the rest of his life.
And how would you do that?
What do you want from it?
He'll be here.
I'm here to see the Jigsaw.
You're out of luck.
I'm here for the Punisher party.
Who's the old man?
Old - country genocidal maniac.
Cops will be all over this place once the fireworks start.
Said we'll be blasting dynamite all night.
I'm going in to get them.
You call that a plan?
Well, I'm going in with you.
Never took the time to think about where I was headed.
You're not going there.
James, be careful.
You should be seeing double right about now.
That would be a torn meniscus.
Let's play a game, what do you say?
You got one round left in there.
You shoot one of these two, I'll let the other one go free.
What do you say, Frank?
Okay, then they both die.
Not looking too good for you, fatso.
After three, Castle. One.
Let me put you out of my misery.
This is just the beginning.
Come on, Frank. I'll buy you a drink.
We talked about you.
He said you were one of the good guys.
You know, buddy.
I mean, you must get tired of this, right?
And I think you got all the criminals in town.
If there are any left, you gotta at least consider rehabilitation.
I mean, contrary to popular belief, people can change.
I guess what I'm saying is, I'm just, personally, not a fan of the death penalty.
Where did he go?
You're kidding, right?
Give me your wallet.
Do you wanna die?
For the last time, give me your wallet.
Sir, we'd like to talk with you for a minute.
Could you open the door, please?
Look, we know you're in there.
You're casting a shadow through your peephole.
All we want to do is talk.
Would you please open the door?
Sir, come on and open up.
You were able to come outside to steal your neighbor's newspaper.
I did n't steal it.
The cover price is 50 cents.
Did your neighbor consent to sell you her paper?
Let's talk about something called "probable cause."
As I'm sure you know, in the state of New Mexico, there is a two - part test to determine whether police officers have an objectively reasonable basis the situation as missing, versus Arizona, as I pointed out, uh, creates an event
Hey, Tommy, come around here, would you?
And that's why the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that a coercive order
Requiring an individual leave his house is seizure, and, therefore, protected under the Fourth Amendment, right?
Whole lot of camp - stove fuel.
You see what he did to the breaker box?
Is he coming out, or are we going in?
You got 10 seconds to open this door, or it's coming down.
You hear me?
Okay, I'll
I'll let you in, but you have to leave your electronic devices outside.
Definitely, definitely no Tasers.
I ca n't emphasize that enough.
Ricky, call me "Ricky."
Well, my Mercedes is in the shop.
I ought to give him a raise.
Jim, I saw you on the TV.
Insight the first, you ai n't afraid to put yourself out there.
And insight the second, you believe in the real America
It's a damned travesty.
I refuse to consider myself a victim.
You know, we are once again at a point in our history where the fly - swatting hand of government is crushing the spirit of entrepreneurship.
Taxes, OSHA requirements, the INS poking their big, fat nose into every mother - loving hire.
Are you ready to clear your calendar?
Ricky, I'm all ears.
Now, I got 1,100 acres of property here, self - sustaining with solar power and wells, a sovereign state immune to the business - killing regulations of the country in which it geographically lies.
We are going to be America's Vatican City.
I'm your man.
Yeah, let's do this.
I'm talking thousands of man-hours
I mean, years of effort.
Let's talk turkey.
What's your rate?
$450 an hour.
The hell with hourly.
I want you on retainer.
Would you like that in cash?
You can call me Jimmy.
God, what was it like climbing that billboard?
Must have been pretty scary?
Guy needed help, that's all.
You know, if I could do it, anybody could.
Well, my hat is off to you.
In fact, I do so many patent cases, I should probably just go ahead and specialize already.
So, what do we got?
It's my idea of a lifetime.
I may have seen one of these before.
This one has this little unit I've added.
This is my invention.
My wife and I have two boys, four and six.
Nightmare, both times.
They just did n't want to use the commode.
So I wired a motion sensor to a voice chip, and, well, no sense getting all technical, but it's all about positive reinforcement.
And when you sit down to do your business, this is how he works.
Oh, yeah, that's the way!
Gosh, you're big!
You're so big!
Fill me up, Chandler!
Put it in me!
Chandler's my youngest
Give it to me, Chandler!
I want it all!
Anyway, it goes on from there.
You get the picture.
It's a little sexual, maybe?
Maybe that's a better word.
Look, I'm not saying this thing wo n't make you rich.
I mean, some of your wealthier Pacific Rim nations, they'll love this, the crazy bastards.
I created this for children.
Well, hey, viagra was originally invented to treat hypertension.
You're completely disgusting, you know that?
Get off my property!
Hey, you know what?
You just stay put.
Now, where were we?
Oh, would you like some more tea?
Now, the Shepherd Boy Hummel, that's gonna go to your nephew Clarence?
As long as he finishes college.
If he drops out, it goes to my niece Raylene.
The girl with the geese.
No, then that would go to your cousin Helen
So long as she never remarries Frederick?
And no matter what, I want the towheaded twins to go to Reverend Lawrence's grandson.
Um, do n't you mean Reverend Hanes?
Cause Reverend Lawrence's grandson is going to get the, uh, lute - playing angel, 'cause he was in the choir.
Very sharp, Mr. McGill.
And here I thought all lawyers were idiots.
No, only half of us are idiots.
The other half are crooks.
Are n't you a spicy one?
If I were 40 years younger, I'd have you buy me a Pina Colada.
Well, if you want me to draw up a DNR, I'll bring a blender and some pineapple.
I knew I'd like you when I saw how you saved that poor man on the television.
Moxie is in such short supply these days.
Well, I pride myself on my moxie.
Now, I hate to do this, but I do need to bring up my payment.
And I'm sorry, but I ca n't accept SH Green Stamps.
Now, my fee is $140.
I'll gladly accept $70 today and $70 when I come back with the completed documents, if
And $20, $40.
Shall we continue, Mr. McGill?
Yes, we shall, Mrs. Strauss.
Put it on the nail, not the skin.
I ca n't help it if your toes are too small.
They should all be the same size
That one I can do.
Yeah, that would be attractive.
How's it go again?
Oh, you're huge, Chandler!
You're a big, big boy!
Oh, where does it end?
Do n't stop, Chandler!
Oh, here it comes!
Is that a piece of corn?
No, do n't.
Did you eat corn, Chandler?
Is that a niblet I see, Chandler?
Hey, good times.
Oh, even your lousy days are more interesting than my good ones.
Yeah, well, we should definitely do something about that.
Seriously, do n't ever try to make a living at this.
Yeah, because I'm really lighting the world on fire in that department.
Two wills, and I started a living trust.
Old people love me.
Maybe you got a future in elder law.
You think I could handle all that glamour?
No, I'm serious.
I've thought about getting into elder law myself.
It's awful what people have to deal with Insurance companies, my scumbag cousins stealing her savings and her pain meds.
Seniors need someone on their side.
What the hell does he want?
I mean, I have n't
I'll see if I can, track Jimmy down.
Chuck, you with me?
Chuck, hey, buddy.
All of this needs to stay on.
No, it needs to be on.
I'm getting security.
No, wait, wait.
Why is n't that one going out?
Jimmy, wait a second.
What's the plan here?
What the hell kind of torture chamber you running here?
He's allergic to electricity, all right?
Come on down now.
No, do n't touch me!
He is this patient's brother.
Please, listen to him.
Wait, Edwin, hold up.
Hold on a second, Edwin.
His name is Jimmy, and, yes, he is gonna calm down.
I need to hear it from you.
I'm calm, okay?
Edwin, why do n't you go wait in the hallway?
I'll call if we need you.
Okay, so, tell me about the electricity.
Yeah, look, I know how it sounds, but it's real.
My phone and stuff
Anything with a battery in it, he ca n't have it near him.
Here's my phone.
Okay, that's it.
Okay, what the hell happened to him?
Why is he here?
Apparently, it started when Charles stole his neighbor's newspaper.
He never leaves the house.
I do n't have all the details, but the police found him in a very agitated state.
He was confrontational and incoherent.
How come you did n't call me?
Uh, why did I have to hear about this through my brother's prick of a law partner?
The only contact information we could find was a business card.
Jimmy, in my opinion, Charles should be committed for 30 days of psychiatric observation.
As a family member, you can submit a petition for him to be evaluated.
There's an excellent facility in Las Cruces.
He can be there tomorrow.
Hey, I'm right here.
Mr. McGill, my name is Dr. Cruz.
Do you know why you're in the hospital?
The police kicked in my door.
No warrant, no cause.
I was n't incoherent.
They just were n't listening.
They tasered me, Jimmy.
I can give you privacy.
Howard called me.
He's very concerned about you.
How are you feeling now, Mr. McGill?
Can you tell me a little more about your Situation?
It's not a situation.
For reasons unknown, my nervous system has become sensitized to certain frequencies of electromagnetic radiation.
Your brother called it an allergy to electricity.
Well, it's an oversimplification, but it's essentially correct.
Electronic devices create their own electromagnetic fields.
The closer I am to such devices, the worse my symptoms.
Burning sensation on my skin, a sharp, cold pain in my bones, muscle fatigue, heart palpitations, blurred vision, tinnitus, vertigo, nausea, shortness of breath, a general
When did you first experience these symptoms?
You left the office 18 months ago.
Well, in that case, uh, must have been almost two years.
That's a long time to live with discomfort.
Oh, there it is.
You think I'm crazy.
I never said that.
No, you did n't, because you're very polite, but you think it.
Otherwise, you would n't be talking about commitment.
You find that idea distressing.
Who the hell would n't?
I find it inappropriate for a person suffering from a physical condition.
Anyone who's spent more than a few minutes with me knows that this is n't some kind of delusion.
Would n't you agree, Kim?
Well, I'm not a doctor.
You've known me for the better part of a decade.
Have you ever seen me exhibit any sign whatsoever of mental illness?
If I thought for one second you could cure me, believe me, I'd jump at the chance.
But with all due respect, psychiatry does n't have the answers.
Section 43 - 1 - 11, part (3),
The proposed commitment is consistent with
the treatment needs of the client and with the least drastic means principle.
Do you think subjecting me to this kind of pain for a month is the least drastic means?
He might as well spend a month in a wood chipper.
I understand your frustration.
You're obviously a highly intelligent man in difficult circumstances.
May I ask you a question, just for my own interest?
What do you do for light, or
How do you prepare food?
I use white - gas lanterns.
For cooking, I have a camp stove.
I have a large cooler I keep filled with ice.
It's not ideal, but I make do.
Would you mind if I took a moment to speak with your brother?
I want to go home.
That was a dirty trick.
That was n't a trick.
This allergy to electricity is n't real.
It's a manifestation of something deeper.
I'm not saying it's 100% real, okay?
But Chuck is smarter than you and me put together, so we're not talking him out of this, and I'm not sending him to a rubber room.
No one is talking about rubber rooms.
He's seen specialists, okay?
So you're ready to give up.
Who's giving up, huh?
That white gas he was talking about? Who do you think brings him that?
And milk and bread and toilet paper and ice and every other damn thing he needs.
Is that helping or enabling?
If you testify in a custodial hearing, he can get the help he needs.
That's in your power.
To be committed involuntarily, he has to be a danger to himself or others.
Coleman lanterns indoors, a camp stove?
I mean, he could burn his house down or the entire neighborhood, and then you're looking at a commitment of 10 to 20 years.
What if he just hurts himself in a household accident?
How does he call for help?
Ignoring this wo n't make it go away.
What would you do?
All I know is, He needs help.
I'm getting him out of here.
A nurse will bring you the release forms.
I thought I'd wait till you got here.
I want you to know that I've talked to the DA, and he absolutely will not sign off on any commitment papers.
This is a physical condition, not a mental one.
Chuck is of sound mind.
I think we can all agree on that.
You're a real peach, Howard.
Of course you do n't want Chuck committed.
Because if Chuck were committed, then I'd become his legal guardian, and I cash him out of HHM.
You want to hash that out while he's lying in here?
You know, the tanning bed must have melted your brain if you think for one second...
Let's stay on point.
We're talking about the well - being of a man whom we all love very much.
There's many factors at play.
You know what, Howard?
I was on the fence till you showed up, but thanks for helping me decide.
Wave bye - bye to your cash cow, 'cause it's leaving the pasture.
Jimmy, can you wait?
Jimmy, wait a second.
Listen, I agree that Chuck needs help, and maybe it's the right thing to do, but you ca n't do it like this.
It's so obvious what he's afraid of.
I'm taking my brother home.
There you go, buddy.
Hey, you're home, all right?
Uh, some tea? A cup of tea?
You want to talk about this?
There's nothing to talk about.
You took the paper.
Chuck, I think you got sick 'cause you saw this story.
No, whenever you think I've done something wrong, something questionable, you get worse.
I did n't get sick because I read about you in the paper.
I got sick because I went out of my house to retrieve the paper.
I'm too tired for this argument, Jimmy.
You think this is the return of Slipping Jimmy, but it's not.
Uh, you think the billboard thing was unethical, but it was
It was advertising, that's all.
Which was n't even allowed until five Supreme Court justices went completely bonkers in Bates versus State Bar of Arizona.
But in any event, It's legal.
If you want to advertise, that's your business.
"Business" being the operative word there, Chuck, because I have gotten business off of this.
Wills, trusts.
Uh, I'm kind of starting to specialize in elder law.
I mean, getting old sucks.
Seniors need someone on their side, so
You're looking at him.
But it has nothing to do with my condition.
I'm gonna make you a promise right now, okay?
No, not necessary, not requested.
The billboard was a one - time thing.
I'm a good lawyer.
I just needed some razzmatazz, you know, to get the ball rolling, some showmanship.
From here on out, I'm gonna play by the rules.
As any lawyer should.
There are clients out there who need me, and I'm gonna give them the best representation
I will be good.
He's back in Cicero, dead and buried.
Somebody's got to make that coffee.
I'm sure the truth will come out, if, indeed, that's what we're all interested in.
I know everybody in this courtroom has strong feelings about Nicholas Baron's past, but I submit he is not on trial here for his past.
He is on trial for the murders of Donald Kovack and Eddie Alonzo.
Light blue or cream.
Oh, what do we got here?
A piece is trying to get away.
Enjoy the Jell - O.
Who's the banker here?
That's the only one I want to talk to.
What a grip, young man!
That's my will - writing hand.
You look beautiful today.
All right over there?
Is that Veronica Lake?
Give me a hug, beautiful.
You look great today.
All right, no cheating.
No hiding the tablet.
Oh, what do we have here?
The man in the booth.
What you reading there?
The Complete Annotated Book of Rules for Parking Validation?
The rules for parking validation are actually pretty simple.
Most people get it on the first try.
Well, you'll be pleased to know I have the requisite stickers.
Need a Will? Call McGill!
Uh, if, uh, you happen to know any elders.
Could n't have a bad one if I tried.
Well, there's nobody around.
Oh, but you never can tell when there's someone around.
Then I'll come in.
Oh, no, Dan, I would n't come in if I were you.
Really, we're going to be awfully late.
Well, do n't be bashful, Lucy.
Well, I'm not bashful, but I've never kissed you before, and I do n't think this is exactly the place.
I ca n't sleep nights.
Oh, why do n't you take some hot milk?
You and me both.

Unlike other girl detectives, Nancy does not go to school (for reasons that are never explained, but assuming because she has finished), and she thus has complete autonomy.
Similar characters, such as Kay Tracey, do go to school, and not only lose a degree of independence but also of authority.
The fact of a character's being a school - girl reminds "the reader, however fleetingly, of the prosaic realities of high - school existence, which rarely includes high adventures or an authoritative voice in the world of adults."

Because cities are warmer, the hot air is more likely to rise, and if the humidity is high it will cause convectional rainfall – short intense bursts of rain and thunderstorms.
Urban areas produce particles of dust (notably soot) and these act as hygroscopic nuclei which encourages rain production.
Because of the warmer temperatures there is less snow in the city than surrounding areas.

These currents begin when a geologic activity pushes sediments over the edge of a continental shelf and down the continental slope, creating an underwater landslide.
A dense slurry of muds and sands speeds towards the foot of the slope, until the current slows.
The decreasing current, having a reduced ability to transport sediments, deposits the grains it carries, thus creating a submarine fan.
The slurry continues to slow as it is moved towards the continental rise until it reaches the ocean bed.
Thus results a series of graded sediments of sand, silt and mud, which are known as turbidites, as described by the Bouma sequence.

Nancy is also treated with respect: her decisions are rarely questioned and she is trusted by those around her.
Male authority figures believe her statements, and neither her father nor Hannah Gruen, the motherly housekeeper, "place... restrictions on her comings and goings."

Some critics, such as Betsy Caprio and Ilana Nash, argue that Nancy's relationship with her continually approving father is satisfying to girl readers because it allows them to vicariously experience a fulfilled Electra complex.

A persistent, large output gap has severe consequences for, among other things, a country's labor market, a country's long - run economic potential, and a country's public finances.
First, the longer the output gap persists, the longer the labor market will underperform, as output gaps indicate that workers who would like to work are instead idled because the economy is not producing to capacity.
The United States' labor market slack is evident in an October 2013 unemployment rate of 7.3 percent, compared with an average annual rate of 4.6 percent in 2007, before the brunt of the recession struck.

Between 1210 and 1347 a large monastery (Kołbacz Abbey) and several farms were built in the area to house the monks.
In sources known as Colbatz, Kolbatz, Colbas, sometimes Mera Vallis which means Bright Valley.
After the secularization of Pomeranian Cistercians in 1555 the area became a private property of the Dukes of Pomerania - Stettin, the monastery was converted into a castle and then into a summer residence of the dukes.
The rulings of the Peace of Westphalia (1648) and the Treaty of Stettin (1653) assigned Kolbatz to Brandenburg, which later became part of the Kingdom of Prussia.
Since 1815 it was within the Province of Pomerania.
After 1945, it became part of Poland.

In the later Tandy period (1946 - 1949) and continuing throughout the 1950s, Nancy is depicted less frequently in the center of the action.
The Ghost of Blackwood Hall shows an assertive Nancy leading more timid friends up the front steps of the haunted house, and marks a transition to later illustrations.
From 1949 forward, she is likely to be observing others, often hiding or concealing herself.
In most cases, more active scenes are used for the frontispiece, or in books after 1954, illustrations throughout the text drawn by uncredited illustrators.
In addition to the character changes, the tone and pacing of the films were also matured and altered for comic effect and to accommodate a wider audience.
The films changed the less - severe crimes and adventures of the books into gruesome murders, often spearheaded by dangerous criminals.
At the time of the films, Nancy and Ned / Ted's romance in the books was set aside for the main mystery; on the other hand, romance was a prominent theme of the films, with Nancy being portrayed as the domineering girlfriend, and Ted as the repressive boyfriend, usually used by Nancy to his misery.
The Wikipedia was started in the beginning of 2005, along with the Bambara Wikipedia and the Fula Wikipedia.

The Nintendo 64 version of Resident Evil 2 differs most from the other releases as its one of the very few games released for the console to have FMVs, overcoming the limited storage space on the cartridge.
The PlayStation version with two CD - ROMs of up to 700 MB per disc, was faithfully replicated (with unique enhancements) on a 64 MB Nintendo 64 Game Pak.
Audio and video assets had to be more aggressively and creatively compressed, using novel techniques that shift the burden more toward the console's high real - time processing power.
Over the course of twelve months and with a budget of $1million, Resident Evil 2 was ported to the console by a team led by nine full - time and one part - time personnel from Angel Studios.
Further help was provided by ten staff from Capcom Production Studio 3 and Factor 5.
This version offers features that were not included on any other system, such as alternate costumes, the ability to adjust the degree of violence and to change the blood color, a randomizer to place items differently during each playthrough, and a more responsive first - person control scheme.
Additionally, the port features 16 new in - game documents known as the "Ex Files", written by Tetsuro Oyama.
Hidden throughout the four scenarios, they reveal new information about the series' lore and connect the story of Resident Evil 2 to those of the other installments, including some that had n't even been released yet at the time.
The Nintendo 64 version adjusts its display resolution depending on the number of polygonal models currently on screen, and supports the console's Expansion Pak accessory for a maximum resolution of 640 × 480 during gameplay.
Other visual enhancements include smoother character animations and sharper, perspective - corrected textures for the 3D models.
The Nintendo 64 version is the only one to use surround sound, with the soundtrack converted to Dolby Surround by Chris Hülsbeck, Rudolf Stember and Thomas Engel.
The team reworked the sound set from the ground up to provide each instrument with a higher sample rate than on the PlayStation, thus resulting in higher - quality music.
Some features from the other enhanced ports based on the Dual Shock Ver. do not appear in the Nintendo 64 version, such as the "Extreme Battle" minigame.
In 2018, Eurogamer called this "one of the most ambitious console ports of all time".
Because of its wide field of view, the Schmidt camera is typically used as a survey instrument, for research programs in which a large amount of sky must be covered.

He and his sons, Antilochus and Thrasymedes, fought on the side of the Achaeans in the Trojan War.
Though Nestor was already very old when the war began, he was noted for his bravery and speaking abilities.
In the Iliad, he often gives advice to the younger warriors and advises Agamemnon and Achilles to reconcile.
He is too old to engage in combat himself, but he leads the Pylian troops, riding his chariot, and one of his horses is killed by an arrow shot by Paris.
He also had a solid gold shield.
Homer frequently calls him by the epithet "the Gerenian horseman." At the funeral games of Patroclus, Nestor advises Antilochus on how to win the chariot race.
Antilochus was later killed in battle by Memnon.

Nancy Drew's popularity continues unabated: in 2002, the first Nancy Drew book published, The Secret of the Old Clock, alone sold 150,000 copies, good enough for top - 50 ranking in children's books, and other books in the series sold over 100,000 copies each.
Sales of the hardcover volumes of the original Nancy Drew series alone has surpassed sales of Agatha Christie titles, and newer titles in the Girl Detective series have reached The New York Times bestseller lists.
Entertainment Weekly ranked her seventeenth on its list of "The Top 20 Heroes" ahead of Batman, explaining that Drew is the "first female hero embraced by most little girls... in an endless summer of never - ending adventures and unlimited potential."
Other web apps Scott has created include "Evil" (a web app that revealed the phone numbers of Facebook users), "Tweleted" (which showed posts deleted from Twitter), "What's Osama bin Watchin?"

There is some debate about the exact date the club was founded.
Some authorities think it may have been as early as 1898 due to the existence of papers addressed to Joseph Whitaker, English consul in Palermo and originally believed to be first club president, about a Palermitan football team founded in the month of April of that year.
Actually, there is a probable misinterpretation of some sources: in April 1897, the future founders of Palemo Calcio founded the association Sport Club.
The most common and officially stated foundation date is 1 November 1900, as the Anglo Palermitan Athletic and Football Club.
The club is thought to have been founded by Ignazio Majo Pagano, a young Palermitan colleague of Whitaker who had discovered football while at college in London in the UK, where the modern game of football originated.
The initial staff comprised three Englishmen and nine natives of Palermo, with Whitaker as honorary chairman, Edward De Garston as inaugural president and with red and blue as the original team colours.
The first recorded football match, played by the team on 30 December 1900, ended in a 5 - 0 defeat to an unidentified amateur English team.
The first official match, played on 18 April 1901 against Messina Football Club, ended in a 3 - 2 win to the Palermitan side.

The new season started with Delio Rossi still in charge of the club: Simon Kjær and Edinson Cavani left the club, and a few more promising youngsters were signed (most notably Argentine Ezequiel Muñoz and the Slovene duo of Armin Bačinović and Josip Iličić), plus more experienced acquisitions such as forwards Massimo Maccarone and Mauricio Pinilla.
Palermo reached their third Coppa Italia finals after defeating Milan 4 - 3 on aggregate on 10 May 2011, losing 3 - 1 to Internazionale in the final.
For the 2011 - 12 season, Delio Rossi was replaced by former Chievo boss Stefano Pioli, who was, however, sacked before the Serie A kickoff after being eliminated by Swiss minnows FC Thun in the Europa League third preliminary round.
In a somewhat surprise move, Pioli was replaced by under - 19 team coach Devis Mangia, with no managerial experience other than at youth team and minor league level; despite that, Mangia turned Palermo fortunes by leading the Rosanero in fifth place thanks to an impressive string of six consecutive home wins, thus deserving a long - term deal at the club.
A string of poor results, however, led Palermo to three consecutive defeats, including elimination from the Coppa Italia and a disappointing loss in the Sicilian derby, persuading Zamparini to replace Mangia with the more experienced Bortolo Mutti.

Despite efforts to protects its IP, a major leak of documents, including source code, design documents, hardware drawings and documentation and other internal information primarily related to the Nintendo 64, GameCube, and Wii, appeared in May 2020.
The leak may have been related to BroadOn, a company that Nintendo had contracted to help with the Wii's design, but also may have been through Zammis Clark, a Malwarebytes employee and hacker who pleaded guilty to infiltrated Microsoft and Nintendo's servers earlier between March and May 2018.

The term "plum rain" was a Chinese term for the rain in the fourth and fifth lunar month.
It specifically refers to the historical belief that, when the plums turn yellow and fall at the south of the Yangtze in the fourth and fifth months, that the moisture that evaporates from the plant turns into rain.
A second larger leak occurred in July 2020, which has been called the "Gigaleak" as it contained over gigabytes of data, and is believed related to the May 2020 leak.
The leak included the source code and prototypes for several early 1990's games on the SNES including Super Mario Kart, Yoshi's Island, Star Fox and Star Fox 2, as well as internal development tools and system software components, with the veracity of the material confirmed by Dylan Cuthbert, a programmer for Nintendo during that period.
The leak also had the source to several Nintendo 64 games including Super Mario 64, The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time and the console's operating system.
The Gigaleak also contained personal files from Nintendo employees, raising concerns about its origins and spread.

However, Novell was also diversifying, moving away from its smaller users to target large corporations, although the company later attempted to refocus with NetWare for Small Business.
It reduced investment in research and was slow to improve the product administration tools, although it was helped by the fact its products typically needed little "tweaking" - they just ran.

Digital Research's FlexOS had been licensed to IBM for their 4690 OS in 1993 and was also utilized for the in - house development of Novell's Embedded Systems Technology (NEST), but was sold off to Integrated Systems, Inc. (ISI) for US$ 3,000,000 in July 1994.
The deal comprised a direct payment of half this sum as well as shares representing 2% of the company.
It is formed by reacting platinum hexafluoride with relatively uncationisable elements and compounds, for example with xenon to form "XePtF 6" (actually a mixture of XeFPtF 5, XeFPt 2F 11, and Xe 2F 3PtF 6), known as xenon hexafluoroplatinate.
The discovery of this reaction in 1962 proved that noble gases form chemical compounds.
Previous to the experiment with xenon, PtF 6 had been shown to react with oxygen to form + −, dioxygenyl hexafluoroplatinate.
It is mostly spoken in Gascony and Béarn in southwestern France (in parts of the following French départements: Pyrénées - Atlantiques, Hautes - Pyrénées, Landes, Gers, Gironde, Lot - et - Garonne, Haute - Garonne, and Ariège) and in the Aran Valley of Catalonia.

Therefore, personal finance education is needed to help an individual or a family make rational financial decisions throughout their life.
Before 1990, mainstream economists and business faculty paid little attention to personal finance.
However, several American universities such as Brigham Young University, Iowa State University, and San Francisco State University have started to offer financial educational programmes in both undergraduate and graduate programmes in the last 30 years.
These institutions have published several works in journals such as The Journal of Financial Counseling and Planning and the Journal of Personal Finance.
Research into personal finance is based on several theories such as social exchange theory and andragogy (adult learning theory).
Professional bodies such as American Association of Family and Consumer Sciences and American Council on Consumer Interests started to play an important role in the development of this field from the 1950s to 1970s.
The establishment of the Association for Financial Counseling and Planning Education (AFCPE) in 1984 at Iowa State University and the Academy of Financial Services (AFS) in 1985 marked an important milestone in personal finance history.
Attendances of the two societies mainly come from faculty and graduates from business and home economics colleges.
AFCPE has since offered several certifications for professionals in this field such as Accredited Financial Counselor (AFC) and Certified Housing Counselors (CHC).
Meanwhile, AFS cooperates with Certified Financial Planner (CFP Board).
Reconstruction was started again in the 20th century, when Dr. Baron Wilibald von Dirksen became the owner of the castle.
He ordered an elaboration of the design to the most well - known and respected architect and conservator, Bodo Ebhardt, who also supervised the work.
In 1908, Emperor Wilhelm II was a guest during the solemn reopening of the castle after the completion of renovations.
The castle was inherited by Dirksen's son, Herbert von Dirksen, who become a prominent German diplomat serving as the ambassador to the Soviet Union, Japan and Great Britain.
In 1945, the castle, with some of its possessions, was burnt.

It's still discussed whether Eddy Wally was a type or not.
Jan Van Rompaey, a former host of many human interest programs and talkshows on Belgian television, interviewed Wally many times.
According to him, Wally had a limited vocabulary and was not a type, although he exaggerated.
Kamagurka has a similar conclusion and insinuated Wally acted strange "because that's what people expects from a famous person".
Convinced that statement is true, Wally just changed his way of life.
Kamagurka also revealed Wally had some kind of dyslexia and wrote all of his lyrics in his own phonetic transcription language.
Wally also had trouble learning scripts, even the most simple ones.

In some years, the rainy season's actual beginning and end are under debate.
For example, in 2005, the subtropical ridge moved quickly northward in late June / early July.
The weather front skipped the Chang Jiang region and there was no rainy season there.
Then, the ridge retreated southward and there was significant rainfall in the region.
This gave rise to the question of whether this was the summer - type rainfall pattern that is common after the first rainy season or the second rainy season.
Some meteorologists even argued that the rainy period in late June was not a true rainy season.

The western term 'technology' comes from the Greek term techne (τέχνη) (art, or craft knowledge) and philosophical views on technology can be traced to the very roots of Western philosophy.
A common theme in the Greek view of techne is that it arises as an imitation of nature (for example, weaving developed out of watching spiders).
Greek philosophers such as Heraclitus and Democritus endorsed this view.
In his Physics Aristotle agreed that this imitation was often the case, but also argued that techne can go beyond nature and complete "what nature can not bring to a finish." Aristotle also argued that nature (physis) and techne are ontologically distinct because natural things have an inner principle of generation and motion, as well as an inner teleological final cause.
While techne is shaped by an outside cause and an outside telos (goal or end) which shapes it.
Natural things strive for some end and reproduce themselves, while techne does not.
In Plato's Timaeus, the world is depicted as being the work of a divine craftsman (Demiurge) who created the world in accordance with eternal forms as an artisan makes things using blueprints.
Moreover, Plato argues in the Laws, that what a craftsman does is imitate this divine craftsman.

Because of the amount of damage due to the war, the fortress was left with some parts of the stronghold missing.
In 1940, the first commercial antifungal drug, called amphotericin B, was available on the market, replacing rare and expensive treatments.
It was effective in its function but was very toxic and only used for serious infections.
The drug was infused into the bloodstream and could cause kidney damage and other side effects.
The first azole compounds to replace this treatment were synthesized in the late 1960s and early 1970s and administered to humans under strict care.
These compounds were imidazoles, a molecule containing two non-adjacent nitrogen atoms in a 5 membered ring.
The first oral antimycotic imidazole, called ketoconazole, was available on the market in 1981.
Triazole based drugs came shortly after and quickly gained popularity due to its broader spectrum of antifungal activity and less toxicity.
Terconazole was the first triazole - based antifungal drug synthesized for human use.
Janssen Pharmaceutica developed it in 1983.
Previously, all triazole based drugs targeted fungal infections related to plants from Candida species.
Since creation, terconazole has been superseded by second - generation triazoles due to their even broader spectrum and higher activity levels against resistant pathogens like Aspergillus spp..
It is still used as a treatment in cases of resistance to other drugs.
Croce was born in Pescasseroli in the Abruzzo region of Italy. His family was influential and wealthy, and he was raised in a very strict Catholic environment.

Maxie (マツブサ, Matsubusa) Voiced by: Keiji Fujiwara (Japanese), Marc Thompson (English) Maxie is the leader of Team Magma.
His goal is to wipe out the sea in order to create more land by using a volcano and Groudon.
He is more misguided than truly evil, as he believes that his actions will benefit others.
Maxie meets Ash in the episode "Gaining Groudon", and tells him of his plans.
He also tells Ash about the Blue Orb, which could control Groudon, and with it in his hands, he could make life better for himself.
It controls Groudon, and a cataclysmic battle begins, resulting in Groudon's victory.
Afterwards, Maxie thanks Ash, realizing that the land of Hoenn was perfect the way it is.
Tabitha (ホムラ, Homura) Voiced by: Yūto Kazama (Japanese), Greg Abbey (English) A member of Team Magma, Tabitha first appeared in "A Three Team Scheme!", where he leads a group of Magma Grunts in an exploration of some ancient ruins on Dewford Island in search of the Cave of Origin.
They also have a confrontation with Team Aqua.
Due to a dubbing error, he is mistakenly referred to as "Field Commander Harlan" during this episode, though his name is corrected in all subsequent appearances.
Tabitha appears again in "The Spheal of Approval", where he and two Magma Grunts break into the Oceanic Museum in order to steal a rock sample owned by Captain Stern.
Although Ash and his friends attempt to stop them, Team Magma successfully makes off with most of the sample.
However, their plans were ultimately thwarted by Ash and Cozmo.
His final appearances are in "Gaining Groudon" and "The Scuffle of Legends".
His submarine accidentally picks up Ash and his friends while out on patrol, bringing them to Team Magma's base.
He is present for the battle between Kyogre and Groudon.
Brodie (バンナイ, Bannai) Voiced by: Katsuyuki Konishi (Japanese), Andrew Paull (English) A spy with Team Magma, known as The Man of a Thousand Faces or Brodie The Phantom Thief, Brodie debuts in the episode "Unfair Weather Friends", disguised as Millie, a scientist at the Weather Institute who is supposed to be collecting data on Groudon.
Team Aqua tries to steal the data directly, unaware "Millie" is really Brodie.
When Shelly threatens to harm Bart and the other scientists at the Institute, Brodie reveals himself as a Team Magma agent and escapes with the information the Institute had gathered on the Legendary Pokémon.
Brodie also appears in "The Ribbon Cup Caper".
He disguises himself as various people, including Officer Jenny, in order to steal the Ribbon Cup for the Hoenn Grand Festival.
When confronted by the real Officer Jenny, Brodie willingly gives up the Ribbon Cup because upon closer inspection "it was n't valuable enough," and flies away once again.
Butler (バトラー, Batorā) Voiced by: Kenji Nojima (young), Kōichi Yamadera, (Japanese), Wayne Grayson (English) A former scientist of Team Magma and a magician, Butler is fired from working with Team Magma because an experiment to create a Groudon from a fossilized remnant of it had failed.
Fueled by bitterness, hatred and an extreme thirst for revenge, Butler assembles plan for alternative ways of creating a Groudon from scratch.
He realizes that he needs a stronger energy source for the regeneration process.
The power that he seeks is only available once in a millennium.
Butler and his girlfriend, Diane, find the crystallized "cocoon" of Jirachi in Forina.
When Ash, Brock, May and Max find Butler at the Millennium Festival, Butler presents Jirachi to Max because Max is supposedly the friend that Jirachi needs to find so it can awaken when the Millennium Comet comes.
Butler uses Jirachi's power in the hopes to create a Groudon from scratch.
However, he ends up with a manifestation of pure evil that resembles Groudon.
When the false Groudon starts sucking up every Pokémon in sight, Butler begs Ash and Max to forgive him and help him to set his machine in reverse to get rid of Groudon.
The plan is a success and the false Groudon is destroyed.
In late 1980 NoA contracted the Seattle - based arcade sales and distribution company Far East Video, consisting solely of experienced arcade salespeople Ron Judy and Al Stone.
The two had already built a decent reputation and a distribution network, founded specifically for the independent import and sales of games from Nintendo because the Japanese company had for years been the under - represented maverick in America.
Now as direct associates to the new NoA, they told Arakawa they could always clear all Nintendo inventory if Nintendo produced better games.
Far East Video took NoA's contract for a fixed per - unit commission on the exclusive American distributorship of Nintendo games, to be settled by their Seattle - based lawyer, Howard Lincoln.: 94 - 103

The pilot was written by Joan Rater and Tony Phelan and directed by James Strong. The pilot was shot in March 2016, on location in New York City.
During this time, Phelan and Rater had another pilot, Doubt, which many television reporters often placed in competition for a series order with Drew.
On May 14, 2016, it was announced that CBS decided to order Doubt, and pass on the Drew pilot, so CBS Studios could shop it to other networks for series consideration.
Some see the film as updated version of the basic character: "although it has been glammed up for the lucrative tween demographic, the movie retains the best parts of the books, including, of course, their intelligent main character." Others find the movie "jolting" because Nancy's "new classmates prefer shopping to sleuthing, and Nancy's plaid skirt, penny loafers, and magnifying glass make her something of a dork, not the town hero she was in the Midwest."

The front and the formation of frontal depressions along it brings precipitation to Primorsky Krai, Japan, Korea, eastern China, and Taiwan.
As the front moves back and forth depending on the strength of cool and warm air masses, there is often prolonged precipitation and sometimes flooding in eastern China.
However, in the years that it does not rain as much as usual, a drought might result.
The rainy season ends when the warm air mass associated with the subtropical ridge is strong enough to push the front north and away.
In 2008, Scott and three other friends formed the comedy troupe "The Technical Difficulties", which they hosted on University Radio York.
The eponymous show later won the Kevin Greening award at the Student Radio Awards.
An untitled game which they played on the radio show was a form of reverse trivia, where Scott would reveal the answer to a trivia question and the other members of the troupe would have to guess the question.
Over time, this evolved into a regular segment titled "Citation Needed", which after the run of the radio show, was revived as a show hosted on Scott's YouTube channel.
In 2009, three episodes of The Technical Difficulties were filmed for television broadcast.
The Technical Difficulties continue to work on a variety of projects together, including a podcast, and on a number of panel - style game shows hosted either on Scott's primary channel or on the Matt & Tom channel he co-hosts with Matt Gray.
Their goal is to liberate Pokémon from trainers and rule Unova.
Resident Evil 2 was promoted with a US$ 5 million advertising campaign.
In Italy, the game reached 100,000 pre-orders, worth over 12 billion lire (about more than 6.6 million dollars).
On the weekend following its release, it sold 380,000 copies and grossed US$ 19 million.
It therefore surpassed the revenue of all but one Hollywood movie at that time and broke previous sales records set by the video games Final Fantasy VII and Super Mario 64.
At the 1999 Milia festival in Cannes, it took home a "Gold" prize for revenues above €29 million in the European Union during the previous year.

Nintendo's next home console was conceived in 2001, although the designing commenced in 2003, taking inspiration from the Nintendo DS.
The Wii was released in November 2006, with a total of 33 launch titles.
With the Wii, Nintendo sought to reach a broader demographic than its seventh generation competitors, with the intention of also encompassing the "non-consumer" sector.
To this end, Nintendo invested in a $200 million advertising campaign.
The Wii's innovations include the Wii Remote controller, equipped with an accelerometer system and infrared sensors that allow it to detect its position in a three - dimensional environment with the aid of a sensor bar; the Nunchuk peripheral that includes an analog controller as well as an accelerometer; and the Wii MotionPlus expansion that increases the sensitivity of the main controller with the aid of gyroscopes.
By 2016, more than 101 million Wii consoles had been sold worldwide, making it the most successful console of its generation, a distinction that Nintendo had not achieved since the 1990s with the SNES.

In April 2012, the company launched the first global last - minute hotel app, ‘ Booking.com Tonight ', designed for iPhone and iPod Touch.
The increase in households where both adults work outside the home, combined with the convenience of shopping for and buying products and services online, has decreased the number of customers going to retail outlets, as consumers can access the same information about products and services without paying for gas, parking and other costs, thus saving them time and money.
Today's consumers lead busy lives and shopping takes time.
Often it is a task.
Consumers find researching and shopping on the Web far more convenient than brick - and - mortar visits.
Another example of this is the introduction of online banking, which has affected bank branches on the High Street: Barclays will shut at least 50 branches this year.
Brick and mortar businesses are not limited to having a physical presence only, they may also have an online presence such as Tesco, who offer an online grocery service as well as a brick and mortar retail presence.
In January 2019, it was reported by ynet and IGN Israel that negotiations about official distribution of Nintendo products in the country were ongoing.
After two months, IGN Israel announced that Tor Gaming Ltd., a company that established in earlier 2019, gained a distribution agreement with Nintendo of Europe, handling official retailing beginning at the start of March, followed by opening an official online store the next month.
In June 2019, Tor Gaming launched an official Nintendo Store at Dizengoff Center in Tel Aviv, making it the second official Nintendo Store worldwide, 13 years after NYC.
MMTV can be transferred either through an exogenous or endogenous route.
If the virus is transferred exogenously, it is passed from the mother mouse to her pups through her milk.
Raccoon City police chief Brian Irons had been bribed by Umbrella to hide evidence of the company's experiments in the outskirts of the city.
He also concealed their development of the new G - virus, an agent capable of mutating a human into the ultimate bioweapon.
Leon has multiple encounters with a Tyrant monster air - dropped into the Raccoon Police Department by Umbrella to seek the G - virus. Irons tries to murder Claire but is killed by a G - virus mutant in the police department.
Thereupon, Claire and Sherry escape through the sewers and become separated.
After splitting up with Leon, Ada comes upon Sherry and picks up a golden pendant the girl loses while running away.
Further into the sewers, Ada reluctantly teams up with Leon again, after he insists on his duty to protect her.
They encounter a middle - aged woman who fires at Ada, but Leon dives between them and takes a bullet himself.
Ada ignores the unconscious Leon and follows the woman, who reveals herself to be Sherry's mother Annette and the wife of William Birkin, the Umbrella scientist who created the G - virus. In an attempt to protect his life's work from special agents sent by the Umbrella headquarters, he injected himself with the virus, which turned him into the malformed creature, "G" and is now chasing Sherry.
Annette recognizes her daughter's pendant and attempts to take it from Ada.
A fight ensues, during which Annette is thrown over a railing.
Ada learns that the golden locket contains a sample of the G - virus, and later - taken over by her emotions - returns to Leon, tending to his bullet wound.
Pratchett and Gaiman had planned to adapt Good Omens as a movie for years, with various directors and writers attached to the project at various times.
In 2011, a television series, written by Terry Jones and Gavin Scott, was first reported to be in the works but no further plans were announced.
After Pratchett's death, Gaiman refused to ever consider working on the adaptation alone but changed his mind when he received a letter from Pratchett, written to be sent after his death, urging him to finish the project.

During the peak of Nintendo's success in the video game industry in the 1990s, their name was ubiquitously used to refer to any video game console, regardless of the manufacturer.
To prevent their trademark from becoming generic, Nintendo pushed usage of the term "game console", and succeeded in preserving their trademark.
Nintendo has used emulation by itself or licensed from third parties to provide means to re-release games from their older platforms on newer systems, with Virtual Console, which re-released classic games as downloadable titles, the NES and SNES library for Nintendo Switch Online subscribers, and with dedicated consoles like the NES Mini and SNES Mini.
However, Nintendo has taken a hard stance against unlicensed emulation of its video games and consoles, stating that it is the single largest threat to the intellectual property rights of video game developers.
Further, Nintendo has taken action against fan - made games which have used significant facets of their IP, issuing cease & desist letters to these projects or Digital Millennium Copyright Act - related complaints to services that host these projects.

For the 2016 - 17 season, Zamparini re-appointed Rino Foschi as director of football; he however resigned after just a month in charge and was replaced by former Trapani director Daniele Faggiano.
Most senior players such as Gilardino, Sorrentino, Vázquez and Maresca were sold and mostly replaced with Alessandro Diamanti plus a number of young and quasi-unknown foreign players.
Ballardini, who was originally confirmed as head coach, left his position after a draw at Inter Milan at the second matchday of the season and was replaced with Serie A newbie Roberto De Zerbi.
De Zerbi's stint as Palermo head coach ended in dismal as he was sacked following Coppa Italia elimination at home against Serie B team Spezia, and after seven league losses in a row, with former club captain Eugenio Corini taking over.
This was followed by Faggiano's resignations; his role was not filled as Zamparini announced his intention to operate in the January 2017 transfer market with the support of a number of consultants of his, mostly Gianni Di Marzio, football agent Davor Ćurković and Dario Šimić (who was successively officially announced as part of the club non-coaching staff).
After two more defeats against relegation battle opponents Empoli and Sassuolo, no major signing in the first half of January and eight points deep into relegation zone, Zamparini however decided to change his mind by appointing Nicola Salerno as new director of football.
These online government services aim at two goals: reducing costs to governments and improving client service.
By offering these services and information online, governments save money, because they do not have to offer as many bricks and mortar client service centers where citizens can come and fill in these forms and pay government bills.
Governments offering e-services can also operate with less civil servants and thus less salary and benefits costs, as the citizens using online services are generally doing all of the administrative tasks (e.g., downloading a form, filling in a form, looking up guidance in an online "help" manual, paying fees) themselves using their home computer.
E-government services also improve service for citizens who have access to a computer, Internet and an online payment method (e.g., a credit card or PayPal), because these citizens are not limited by the 9 am - 5 pm or 8 am - 4 pm business hours of most physical government offices, and citizens do not have to incur the costs of transportation (e.g., bus tickets, gas, parking, etc.) associated with going to a bricks and mortar location.
Nevertheless, government e-services do not help all citizens, due to the digital divide; citizens who are in poverty, who are homeless or who live in rural or remote regions may not have access to high speed Internet.
These citizens, as well as those who are not comfortable with computers or those who do not understand how to use them, which in practice means elderly people, are not able to benefit from e-services.
In November 2010, the company launched a hotel and lodging mobile app for the iPad.
In control theory and stability theory, root locus analysis is a graphical method for examining how the roots of a system change with variation of a certain system parameter, commonly a gain within a feedback system.
This is a technique used as a stability criterion in the field of control systems developed by Walter R. Evans which can determine stability of the system. The root locus plots the poles of the closed loop transfer function in the complex S plane as a function of a gain parameter (see pole - zero plot).

With improvements in technology comes progress and a great concern over its shadowing effect on society.
Lelia Green uses recent gun massacres such as the Port Arthur Massacre and the Dunblane Massacre to bring out the concepts of technological determinism and social determinism.
Technological determinism argues that "it was features of technology that determined its use and the role of a progressive society was to adapt to technological change." The alternative perspective would be social determinism which looks upon society being at fault for the "development and deployment" of technologies.
Reactions to the gun massacres were different in various regions.
Tasmanian authorities made gun laws even stricter than before, while there was a demand in the US for the advocacy of fire arms.
And here lies the split, both in opinion and in social dimension.
According to Green, a technology can be thought of as a neutral entity only when the sociocultural context and issues circulating the specific technology are removed.
It will be then visible to us that there lies a relationship of social groups and power provided through the possession of technologies.
In the summer of 2002, Friulian businessman and Venezia owner Maurizio Zamparini acquired the club from Franco Sensi in a €15million bid, with the clear intention to bring Palermo back to Serie A and establishing the club as a Serie A regular with aims of participations to European competitions.
Palermo failed in its first attempt to reach the Serie A in 2002 - 03 on the final week of the season, but later managed to achieve it after a hard but successful 2003 - 04 campaign which saw Palermo crowned as Serie B champions and promoted to Serie A after 31 years, under head coach Francesco Guidolin, who was hired in January 2004 as replacement for dismissed Silvio Baldini.

With the exception of the game's critically acclaimed Nintendo 64 port, most later releases of Resident Evil 2 have received slightly lower scores than the PlayStation version.
Weigand advised players who already owned Resident Evil 2 to rent the Dual Shock Ver. for the "Extreme Battle" minigame, and recommended that newcomers buy the updated edition instead of the original release.
The Windows port was praised for its additional content, but criticized for not allowing the player to save at will, and for lacking updated backgrounds to fit the higher in - game resolution.
Eurogamer said the PC's total elimination of CD - ROM load times make the game "extremely fun and simple".
The Nintendo 64 version was widely commended for the technical achievement of fitting a two - disc game on a single 512 - Mbit (64 MB) cartridge.
However, Taylor criticized this version for retaining scenes from the PlayStation version that were used to conceal loading times - a technical disadvantage of optical discs that cartridges do not share.
A GamePro writer under the pseudonym "The Freshman" was impressed with the enhanced graphics of the Nintendo 64 port, but was disappointed by its heavily compressed CG FMVs.
GameSpot's Joe Fielder found the compression to be forgivable given the cartridge format, and noted that the new exclusive features made up for the lack of the "Extreme Battle" mode.
Eurogamer said the Nintendo 64's unique analog control "works supremely well to the point where it's borderline game - breaking".
IGN reviewer Matt Casamassina applauded the implementation of Dolby Surround support, and called the Nintendo 64 release the "best version of the game".
In 2018, Eurogamer called it "one of the most ambitious console ports of all time".
It was commonly used to induce sleep in sufferers from delirium tremens but has been replaced by other drugs in this regard.
It is one of the safest hypnotics and was regularly given at bedtime in psychiatric hospitals and geriatric wards up to the 1970s.
Up to 30% of the dose is excreted via the lungs (the rest via the liver).
This contributes to a strong unpleasant odour on the breath.
The factoring of K and the use of simple monomials means the evaluation of the rational polynomial can be done with vector techniques that add or subtract angles and multiply or divide magnitudes.
The vector formulation arises from the fact that each monomial term in the factored G (s) H (s), (s − a) for example, represents the vector from a to s.
The polynomial can be evaluated by considering the magnitudes and angles of each of these vectors.
According to vector mathematics, the angle of the result is the sum of all the angles in the numerator add minus the sum of all the angles in the denominator. Similarly, the magnitude of the result is the product of all the magnitudes in the numerator divided by the product of all the magnitudes in the denominator.
It turns out that the calculation of the magnitude is not needed because K varies; one of its values may result in a root.
So to test whether a point in the s - plane is on the root locus, only the angles to all the open loop poles and zeros need be considered. A graphical method that uses a special protractor called a "Spirule" was once used to determine angles and draw the root loci.
Nintendo has generally been proactive to assure its intellectual property in both hardware and software is protected.

The poem is split into two parts: in the first part, Siegfried comes to Worms to acquire the hand of the Burgundian princess Kriemhild from her brother King Gunther.
Gunther agrees to let Siegfried marry Kriemhild if Siegfried helps Gunther acquire the warrior - queen Brünhild as his wife.
Siegfried does this and marries Kriemhild; however Brünhild and Kriemhild become rivals, leading eventually to Siegfried's murder by the Burgundian vassal Hagen with Gunther's involvement.
In the second part, the widow Kriemhild is married to Etzel, king of the Huns.
She later invites her brother and his court to visit Etzel's kingdom intending to kill Hagen.
Her revenge results in the death of all the Burgundians who came to Etzel's court as well as the destruction of Etzel's kingdom and the death of Kriemhild herself.

Acid growth refers to the ability of plant cells and plant cell walls to elongate or expand quickly at low (acidic) pH. The cell wall needs to be modified in order to maintain the turgor pressure.
This modification is controlled by plant hormones like auxin.
Auxin also controls the expression of some cell wall genes.
This form of growth does not involve an increase in cell number.
During acid growth, plant cells enlarge rapidly because the cell walls are made more extensible by expansin, a pH - dependent wall - loosening protein.
Expansin loosens the network - like connections between cellulose microfibrils within the cell wall, which allows the cell volume to increase by turgor and osmosis.
A typical sequence leading up to this would involve the introduction of a plant hormone (auxin, for example) that causes protons (H + ions) to be pumped out of the cell into the cell wall.
As a result, the cell wall solution becomes more acidic.
It was suggested by different scientist that the epidermis is a unique target of the auxin but this theory has been disapproved over time.
This activates expansin activity, causing the wall to become more extensible and to undergo wall stress relaxation, which enables the cell to take up water and to expand.
The acid growth theory has been very controversial in the past.
After World War II, the team returned to Serie A by winning the Serie B championship of 1947 - 48.
The new Palermo squad featured players such as Czechoslovakian legend Čestmír Vycpálek who signed from Juventus alongside Conti, Carmelo Di Bella and Pavesi.
Palermo played Serie A until they were relegated in 1954.
Massive changes in the board, as well as the manager's job and the squad, proved successful and the club returned to Serie A in 1956.
Palermo became a "yo - yo club", bouncing up and down between the top two Italian leagues. Several stars played for Palermo during this period, such as Argentine striker Santiago Vernazza (51 goals in 115 games with the Rosanero), goalkeepers Roberto Anzolin and Carlo Mattrel, Giuseppe Furino and Franco Causio.
Palermo marked its best campaign in 1961 - 62 season, finishing in eighth place in Serie A. In 1963, however, they were relegated to Serie B, where they played for five seasons.
Palermo played again in Serie A between 1968 and 1970.

Relations with the French deteriorated dramatically in 1918 when a serious dispute arose over the legitimacy of levying corvée labour under the traditional practice of fanompoana, in which Sakalava subjects paid their respects to their deceased ancestors and reconfirmed their loyalty to the monarch.
Binao had been required to obtain French permission for work on the royal tombs but she had sought to evade it by sending a request which was timed to reach the colonial authorities after the work had already begun.
The plan failed and resulted in reprisals against subjects who participated in the fanompoana and against Binao herself, who was evicted from her doany (royal palace) and made to pass it on to her half - brother Amada.
She was forced to live instead in the town of Hellville (now Andoany), inflicting a humiliating blow against the monarchy.
Amada succeeded her as king on her death and reigned until 1963.
He was married to Minnie Frances Clark - Kennedy on 1 June 1893 and had three children.

All large retailers in the 19th and the early to mid-20th century started off with a smaller brick and mortar presence, which increased as the businesses grew.
A prime example of this is McDonald's, a company that started with one small restaurant and now has nearly 36,000 restaurants in over 120 countries and plans to grow further; this shows the importance of having a physical presence. For many small businesses, their business model is mostly limited to a bricks and mortar model, such as a diner restaurant or a dry cleaning service.
Nevertheless, even service - based businesses can use websites and "apps" to reach new customers or improve their services.
For example, a dry cleaning service could use a website to let customers know of the hours and location (s) of their bricks and mortar stores.
Using a few basic rules, the root locus method can plot the overall shape of the path (locus) traversed by the roots as the value of K varies.
The plot of the root locus then gives an idea of the stability and dynamics of this feedback system for different values of K.

The late 1980s marked the slip of Nintendo's dominance in the video game market with the appearance of NEC's PC Engine and Sega's Mega Drive, game systems designed with a 16 - bit architecture that allowed for improved graphics and audio compared to the NES.
In response to the competition, Uemura designed the Super Famicom, which launched in 1990.
The first batch of 300,000 consoles sold out in a matter of hours.
The following year, as with the NES, Nintendo distributed a modified version of the Super Famicom to the United States market, titled the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES).
Launch games for the Super Famicom and SNES include Super Mario World, F - Zero, Pilotwings, SimCity, and Gradius III.
By mid-1992, over 46 million Super Famicom and SNES consoles were sold.

In June 2020 astronomers reported observations of a flash of light that might be associated with GW190521.
The Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) reported a transient optical source within the region of the GW190521g trigger, though as the uncertainty in sky position was hundreds of square degrees the association remains uncertain.
If the two events are actually linked, the event is claimed to be the first finding of an electromagnetic source related to the merger of two black holes.
Mergers of black holes do not typically emit any light.
The researchers suggest that it could be explained if the merging of the two smaller black holes sent the newly formed intermediate mass black hole on a trajectory that hurtled through the accretion disk of an unrelated but nearby supermassive black hole, disrupting the disk material and producing a flare of light.
If this explanation is correct, the flare should repeat after about 1.6 years when the intermediate mass black hole again encounters the accretion disk.

Nancy's name is often changed in translated editions: in France, she is known as Alice Roy; in Sweden, as Kitty Drew; in Finland, as Paula Drew; and in Norway the book series has the name of Frøken Detektiv (Miss Detective), though the heroine's name is still Nancy Drew inside the books.
In Germany, Nancy is a German law student named Susanne Langen.
George Fayne's name is even more frequently changed, to Georgia, Joyce, Kitty, or Marion.
Cover art and series order is often changed as well, and in many countries only a limited number of Drew books are available in translation.
It has been used in the treatment of convulsions.
The earliest Nancy Drew books were published as dark blue hardcovers with the titles stamped in orange lettering with dark blue outlines and no other images on the cover.
The covers went through several changes in early years: leaving the orange lettering with no outline and adding an orange silhouette of Nancy peering through a magnifying glass; then changing to a lighter blue board with dark blue lettering and silhouette; then changing the position of the title and silhouette on the front with black lettering and a more "modern" silhouette.
Apparently affluent (her father is a successful lawyer), she maintains an active social, volunteer, and sleuthing schedule, as well as participating in athletics and the arts, but is never shown as working for a living or acquiring job skills.
Nancy is affected neither by the Great Depression - although many of the characters in her early cases need assistance as they are poverty - stricken - nor by World War II.
Some critics prefer the Nancy of these volumes, largely written by Mildred Benson.
Benson is credited with "... a feisty spirit into Nancy's character." The original Nancy Drew is sometimes claimed "to be a lot like herself - confident, competent, and totally independent, quite unlike the cardboard character that Stratemeyer had outlined."
Molina auditioned for Univision's reality show and beauty pageant Nuestra Belleza Latina 2015 in New York City on October 4, 2014.
Judge Jomari Goyso and guest judges Daniel Arenas and Veronica Bastos did not give her a pass to enter the competition due to them seeing her as arrogant.
Days later head judge Osmel Sousa went to her home in New Jersey to personally invite her to be part of the competition.
After several eliminations, she was selected to be part of the 12 finalists who enter the mansion of Nuestra Belleza Latina where she became a favorite among both the judges and audience.

Consistent with other Stratemeyer Syndicate properties, the Nancy Drew novels were written by various writers, all under the pen name Carolyn Keene.
Contracts stated that authors could not use their Stratemeyer Syndicate pseudonyms independently of the Syndicate.
In the early days of the Syndicate, ghostwriters were paid a fee of $125, "roughly equivalent to two month's wages for a typical newspaper reporter, the primary day job of the Syndicate ghosts."
The videos were shared on Facebook among friends, and soon they had several hundred thousand views.

The story of Resident Evil 1.5, with which Mikami planned to end the series, was criticized by supervisor Yoshiki Okamoto, who found it to be too conclusive to allow for future installments.
Instead, Okamoto proposed the creation of a fictional universe that would turn Resident Evil into a metaseries - similar to the Gundam and James Bond franchises - in which self - contained stories with common elements could be told.
During a period in which the team made no progress rewriting the scenario, Okamoto was introduced to professional screenwriter Noboru Sugimura, who was enthusiastic about the first game's story.
Sugimura was initially consulted on a trial basis, but Okamoto was impressed by the ease with which the writer came up with solutions to the problems that plagued the script, and soon asked him to compose the entire scenario for Resident Evil 2.
To fulfill Capcom's sales plan of two million copies, director Kamiya tried to attract new customers with a more ostentatious and Hollywood - like story presentation.
As Okamoto did not want to simply enforce the new direction, he had Sugimura discuss the plot revisions with Mikami and the development staff.
The planners redesigned the game from the ground up to fit the changes, and the programmers and other remaining members of the team were sent to work on Resident Evil Director's Cut, which was shipped with a playable preview disc of the new Resident Evil 2 version in order to promote the sequel and to apologize to the players for its belated release.

Used since the 1960s, Nintendo's most recognizable logo is the racetrack shape, especially the red - colored wordmark typically (though not always) displayed on a white background, primarily used in the Western markets from 1985 to 2006.
In Japan, a monochromatic version that lacks a colored background is on Nintendo's own Famicom, Super Famicom, Nintendo 64, GameCube, and handheld console packaging and marketing.
Since 2006, in conjunction with the launch of the Wii, Nintendo changed its logo to a gray variant that lacks a colored background inside the wordmark, making it transparent.

Beginning with Tandy in 1948 and continuing into the early 1950s, Nancy's appearance was updated to follow the prevailing styles.
In postwar opulence, a trend emerged for young adults to have their own casual style, instead of dressing in the same styles as more mature adults, and Nancy becomes less constrained.

One such accusation involves the IRAS infrared space observatory, launched in 1983.
The satellite briefly made headlines due to an "unknown object" that was at first described as "possibly as large as the giant planet Jupiter and possibly so close to Earth that it would be part of this Solar System".
This newspaper article has been cited by proponents of the Nibiru cataclysm, beginning with Lieder herself, as evidence for the existence of Nibiru.
However, further analysis revealed that of several initially unidentified objects, nine were distant galaxies and the tenth was "galactic cirrus"; none were found to be Solar System bodies.

In October 2018, The CW announced that Josh Schwartz and Stephanie Savage were developing a new Nancy Drew series.
This one would revolve around Nancy as she is about to head off to college, only a "family tragedy" holds her back another year, and she finds herself in a "ghostly murder investigation".
Nancy's hometown is in Horseshoe Bay in Maine, instead of River Heights Illinois.
After the pilot was shot, Freddie Prinze Jr. was replaced by Scott Wolf.
The pier and aerial shots were filmed in Horseshoe Bay, West Vancouver

It is priced at about 4.50 PLN (1.60 USD) for a 0.70 L bottle.
Sometimes a deposit is required on bottles, which is usually 20 - 30% of the wine price.
NoA's staff - except the sole young gamer Howard Phillips - were uniformly revolted at the sight of the freshman developer Miyamoto's debut game, which they had imported in the form of emergency conversion kits for the overstock of Radar Scope cabinets. The kits transformed the cabinets into NoA's massive windfall gain of $280 million from Miyamoto's smash hit Donkey Kong in 1981 - 1983 alone. They sold 4,000 new arcade units each month in America, making the 24 - year - old Phillips "the largest volume shipping manager for the entire Port of Seattle".
Arakawa used these profits to buy 27 acres (11ha) of land in Redmond in July 1982 and to perform the $50 million launch of the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1985 which revitalized the entire video game industry from its devastating 1983 crash.
A second warehouse in Redmond was soon secured, and managed by Don James.
The company stayed at around 20 employees for some years.
The most significant adverse reactions (≥ 2%) reported in clinical trials were diarrhea, abdominal pain, bloating, nausea, upper respiratory tract infection, vomiting, and flatulence.

NGC 1873 (also known as ESO 85 - SC54) is a open cluster associated with an emission nebula located in the Dorado constellation within the Large Magellanic Cloud.
It was discovered by James Dunlop on September 24, 1826 and rediscovered by John Herschel on January 2 1837.
Its apparent magnitude is 10.4, and its size is 3.50 arc minutes.
When the mouse reaches puberty the virus begins to express its messenger RNA in the estrogen sensitive tissues.
As a result, after puberty all mammary cells will contain the active retrovirus and begin to replicate in the genome and express viral messenger RNA in all new mammary tissue cells.
A poll conducted in Béarn in 1982 indicated that 51% of the population could speak Gascon, 70% understood it, and 85% expressed a favourable opinion regarding the protection of the language.
However, use of the language has declined dramatically over recent years as a result of the Francization taking place during the last centuries, as Gascon is rarely transmitted to young generations any longer (outside of schools, such as the Calandretas).

Dexlansoprazole is used to heal and maintain healing of erosive esophagitis and to treat heartburn associated with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).
It lasts longer than lansoprazole, to which it is chemically related, and needs to be taken less often.
There is not good evidence that it works better than other PPIs.
Palermo ended the season in 19th place, being relegated to Serie B. The takeover, originally scheduled to be finalized by 30 April 2017 and then delayed by 30 June, eventually collapsed after Zamparini, who in the meantime had appointed Bruno Tedino as new head coach for the 2017 - 18 Serie B campaign, rejected the final offer he received from Baccaglini.
On 4 July 2017, Baccaglini resigned as Palermo chairmen, falling back into the hands of Zamparini, after the necessary funds were not in place.
The castle was later transferred to Silesian Society of History and Antiquarianism Lovers for use as a museum, restaurant and a shelter - home.
Commercial artist Russell H. Tandy was the first artist to illustrate Nancy Drew.
Tandy was a fashion artist and infused Nancy with a contemporary fashion sensibility: her early style is that of a flatfoot flapper: heeled Mary Janes accompany her blue flapper skirt suit and cloche hat on three of the first four volume dust jackets.
As styles changed over the next few years, Nancy began to appear in glamorous frocks, with immaculately set hair, pearls, matching hats, gloves, and handbags.
In the post-war era, Tandy's Nancy is shown hatless, wearing casual skirt and blouse ensembles, and carrying a purse, like most teens of the late 1940s.

A saeculum is a length of time roughly equal to the potential lifetime of a person or, equivalently, of the complete renewal of a human population.
The term was first used by the Etruscans.
Originally it meant the period of time from the moment that something happened (for example the founding of a city) until the point in time that all people who had lived at the first moment had died.
At that point a new saeculum would start.
According to legend, the gods had allotted a certain number of saecula to every people or civilization; the Etruscans themselves, for example, had been given ten saecula.
García has taught acting at the theatre school of the University of Chile, at Fernando González night school, at the University for the Arts, Sciences, and Communication and the University for Development.
Between 1997 and 2001, she founded and formed a part of the Theatre Directors Association (Asociación de Directores de Teatro, ADT).
Later, work on the tree recommenced after a meeting with Catholic Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith, the archbishop of Colombo.
Originally the tree was planned to be 100 metres (330ft) tall but the height had to be reduced to 72.1 metres (237ft) due to the delays in construction.
A 20 feet (6.1 m) Santa Claus with a sled was placed near the tree.

Nancy Drew (2002 film)
For many years, Nintendo had a policy of strict content guidelines for video games published on its consoles.
Although Nintendo allowed graphic violence in its video games released in Japan, nudity and sexuality were strictly prohibited.
Former Nintendo president Hiroshi Yamauchi believed that if the company allowed the licensing of pornographic games, the company's image would be forever tarnished.
Nintendo of America went further in that games released for Nintendo consoles could not feature nudity, sexuality, profanity (including racism, sexism or slurs), blood, graphic or domestic violence, drugs, political messages or religious symbols (with the exception of widely unpracticed religions, such as the Greek Pantheon).
The Japanese parent company was concerned that it may be viewed as a "Japanese Invasion" by forcing Japanese community standards on North American and European children.
Past the strict guidelines, some exceptions have occurred: Bionic Commando (though swastikas were eliminated in the US version), Smash TV and Golgo 13: Top Secret Episode contain human violence, the latter also containing implied sexuality and tobacco use; River City Ransom and Taboo: The Sixth Sense contain nudity, and the latter also contains religious images, as do Castlevania II and III.

Critical reaction to these films is mixed.
Some find that the movies did not "depict the true Nancy Drew", in part because Granville's Nancy "blatantly used her feminine wiles (and enticing bribes)" to accomplish her goals.
The films also portray Nancy as childish and easily flustered, a significant change from her portrayal in the books.
Just as with the critics, both ghostwriter Mildred Wirt and editor Harriet Adams were also divided on the film's reception.
Adams did not like the films, and resented the studio for its treatment of the character; she did, however, keep a personal autographed photo from Granville on her office desk for many years according to her employees, and may have used John Litel's portrayal of Carson Drew to revamp the character when she revised the books in the 1960s and 1970s.
Contrary to Adams, Benson was said to have liked the films of the time, despite them being different from the character she wrote.
Chemically, clobenzorex is an N - substituted amphetamine analog that is converted to d - amphetamine soon after ingestion.
In commercial production, clobenzorex is supplied in 30 mg doses as the hydrochloride salt in green - tinted capsules.
The drug gained use as a prescription anorectic in the 1970s; however, adverse reactions were eventually observed, which led to the prohibition of clobenzorex in the United States and certain other countries.
Novell acquired Digital Research in June 1991.
NetWare used DRDOS as a boot loader and maintenance platform, and Novell intended to extend its desktop presence by integrating networking into DRDOS and providing an alternative to Microsoft's Windows.
At first, the idea was to provide a graphical environment based on Digital Research's GEM, but Novell's legal department rejected this due to apprehension of a possible legal response from Apple, so the company went directly to Apple starting Star Trek in February 1992, a project to run an x86 - port of their Mac OS on top of a multitasking DRDOS.
In 1907, the club changed its name to Palermo Foot - Ball Club, and the team colours were changed to the current pink and black.
From 1908 until the final event in 1914, Palermo was featured in the Lipton Challenge Cup, organised by Scottish businessman Sir Thomas Lipton.
The competition saw them face off against Naples; Palermo won the competition three times, including a 6 - 0 victory in 1912.
He later captained the Hitchhikers in series 3 of BBC Four's Only Connect in 2010 but was knocked out by the Strategists in the semi-finals.
In 2012, Scott took part in the Sky 1 series Gadget Geeks alongside Colin Furze and Creative Technologist Charles Yarnold, where he was responsible for the creation of software solutions.
Scott received widespread coverage in 2013 for "Actual Facebook Graph Searches", a Tumblr site which exposed potentially embarrassing or dangerous collation of public Facebook data using Facebook's Graph Search, such as showing men in Tehran who have said that they were "interested in men" or "single women who live nearby and are interested in men and like getting drunk".
One year later, Scott worked part - time for UsVsTh3m for over a year.
In the whole Gorce range there are hundreds of species of plants, including Alpine and Subalpine plants which grow on meadows.
Forests cover about 95% of park's area and most common species are spruce, beech and fir.
There are some openings which are mostly the result of prior human activity.
First settlers appeared in the Gorce area in the 14th century but Gorce's forests suffered most in the 19th century.
Back then, trees were cut down on a large scale, especially in easily accessible areas.
Expensive and luxury products
The club could not finish the 1942 - 43 season due to the arrival of WWII.
At the same time the pink - and - black colors were chosen because Sicily became a "war zone".
After the conflict, the club changed its name to US Palermo.
In 1994, Novell also bought WordPerfect Corporation, as well as acquiring Quattro Pro from Borland.

In recent years, Nintendo has taken legal action against sites that knowingly distribute ROM images of their games.
On 19 July 2018, Nintendo sued Jacob Mathias, the owner of ROM image distribution websites LoveROMs and LoveRetro, for "brazen and mass - scale infringement of Nintendo's intellectual property rights." Nintendo settled with Mathias in November 2018 for more than US$ 12 million along with relinquishing all ROM images in their ownership.
While Nintendo is likely to have agreed to a smaller fine in private, the large amount was seen as a deterrent to prevent similar sites from sharing ROM images.
Nintendo filed a separate suit against RomUniverse in September 2019 which also offered infringing copies of Nintendo DS and Switch games in addition to ROM images.
Nintendo also successfully won a suit in the United Kingdom that same month to force the major Internet service providers in the country to block access to sites that offered copyright - infringing copies of Switch software or hacks for the Nintendo Switch to run unauthorized software.
Ironically, individuals who hacked the Wii Virtual Console version of Super Mario Bros. discovered that the ROM image Nintendo used had likely been downloaded from a ROM distribution site.
The result was NetWare v5 .0, released in October 1998, which leveraged and built upon eDirectory and introduced new functions, such as Novell Cluster Services (NCS, a replacement for SFT - III) and Novell Storage Services (NSS), a replacement for the traditional Turbo FAT filesystem used by earlier versions of NetWare.
While NetWare v5 .0 introduced native TCP / IP support into the NOS, IPX was still supported, allowing for smooth transitions between environments and avoiding the "forklift upgrades" frequently required by competing environments.
Similarly, the traditional Turbo FAT file system remained a supported option.
Silvina Reinaudi (born 12 March 1942) is an Argentine children's literature writer and puppeteer, best known for her numerous plays with puppets presented in Argentina and Spain.
Her portraiture project, "Stranger in a Familiar Land", explores the persecution of albinos in sub-Saharan Africa, in which they are hunted for the perceived magical powers of their body parts.
The series sets an albino woman against a background of the Nairobian slums of Kibera, which represent the stormy outside world.
The model's dreamlike pose in societal isolation reflects both the model's alienation and the photographer's hesitance towards her society.
Waiswa developed the project to raise awareness after reading a newspaper article about treatment of albinos in Tanzania.
Part of their shoot consisted of responding to the jeering throng.
Aida Muluneh, the photographer who presented the award, described Waiswa's photography as reflecting her surroundings' complexities.
While Sarah Moroz of i - D praised the clarity with which Waiswa presented the isolation of albino identity, as the model's lighthearted accessories defied an insurmountable air of rejection, Sean O'Hagan of The Guardian considered the otherwise "brave" effort "oddly overstaged".

The first steps to protect this land go back to 1927, when a forest reserve was set up on land owned by Count Ludwik Wodzicki of Poręba Wielka.
The National Park was created in 1981, then covering 23.9 square kilometres.
The area of the protective zone around the park is 166.47 km ².
The park lies within Limanowa County and Nowy Targ County, and has its headquarters in Poręba Wielka.
For the new Serie B campaign, Zamparini appointed former Milan and Italy international star Gennaro Gattuso as the new manager, despite him having little prior managerial experience; he was sacked in September 2013, the 28th sacked manager in 11 years.
Fortune was reversed rather rapidly, however, as Palermo regained promotion back to Serie A for the 2014 - 15 season thanks to a 1 - 0 victory over Novara on 3 May 2014 under the guidance of Giuseppe Iachini, who took the reins over after Gattuso was sacked due to poor results, with the Rosanero responding with a record - breaking Serie B season ended with 86 points, one more than previous record holders Juventus, Chievo and Sassuolo (all of them in the 22 - team Serie B format).
Maison Louis Latour has over two centuries of Burgundian history.
The Latour family themselves have been wine - growers since the 17th century, slowly building up a unique Domaine of 50 hectares (125 acres).
Latour has 33 hectares of vineyards in Aloxe - Corton, where Château Corton Grancey is based.
The beautiful Winery Corton Grancey was built in 1834 and was the first purpose - built winery in France.
Its cellars, embedded in the rock of Corton "Perrières" provide perfect ageing conditions.
The difference between the two represents the GDP gap.
Nintendo founded its North American subsidiary in 1980 as Nintendo of America (NoA).
Hiroshi Yamauchi appointed his son - in - law Minoru Arakawa as president, who in turn hired his own wife and Yamauchi's daughter Yoko Yamauchi as the first employee.
The Arakawa family moved from Vancouver to select an office in Manhattan, New York, due to its central status in American commerce.
Both from extremely affluent families, their goals were set more by achievement than money - and all their seed capital and products would now also be automatically inherited from Nintendo in Japan, and their inaugural target is the existing $8 billion - per - year coin - op arcade video game market and largest entertainment industry in the US, which already outclassed movies and television combined.
During the couple's arcade research excursions, NoA hired gamer youths to work in the filthy, hot, ratty warehouse in New Jersey for the receiving and service of game hardware from Japan.: 94 - 103
Lloréns Torres returned to Puerto Rico in 1901, married, and moved to Ponce where he established his own law firm (Nemesio Canales later joined his firm) and collaborated with the newspaper Lienzos del Solar.

In 1947, Herbert A. Simon, a Nobel laureate, suggested that a decision maker did not always make the best financial decision because of limited educational resources and personal inclinations.
In 2009, Dan Ariely suggested the 2008 financial crisis showed that human beings do not always make rational financial decisions, and the market is not necessarily self - regulating and corrective of any imbalances in the economy.
A series of undercover investigative videos released in March 2018 showed Cambridge Analytica's Chief Executive Officer, Alexander Nix, boasting about using prostitutes, bribery sting operations, and honey traps to discredit politicians on whom it conducted opposition research.
Nix also claimed that the company "ran all of (Donald Trump's) digital campaign", including possible illegal activities.
The Information Commissioner of the UK has asked for a warrant to search the company's servers.
Arakawa was still panicked over NoA's ongoing financial crisis.
With the parent company having no new game ideas, he had been repeatedly pleading for Yamauchi to reassign some top talent away from existing Japanese products to develop something for America - especially to redeem the massive dead stock of Radar Scope cabinets.
Since all of Nintendo's key engineers and programmers were busy, and with NoA representing only a tiny fraction of the parent's overall business, Yamauchi allowed only the assignment of Gunpei Yokoi's young assistant who had no background in engineering, Shigeru Miyamoto.: 106
Colantuono was confirmed as Palermo boss for the 2008 - 09 season.
During the summer transfer market, club stars like Amauri, Andrea Barzagli and Cristian Zaccardo were sold.
New signings included former and current Italian internationals Marco Amelia, Fabio Liverani and Antonio Nocerino.
The Rosanero started their season with a disappointing 2 - 1 home loss to Lega Pro Prima Divisione side Ravenna in the Third Round of the Coppa Italia.
After just one game from the new campaign, a 3 - 1 loss to Udinese, Zamparini sacked Colantuono, and the head coach role was given to Davide Ballardini.
With Ballardini as head coach, Palermo ended the season with a respectable eighth place, and also won its first Campionato Nazionale Primavera national title, under the guidance of youth coach Rosario Pergolizzi.
After the end of the season, Palermo dismissed Ballardini from the coaching post following disagreements with the board, and replaced him with Walter Zenga, whose appointment from Sicilian arch-rivals Catania was greeted with surprise and dismay from supporters of both parties.
Zenga's reign, however, lasted only 13 games, as he was dismissed on 23 November 2009 due to poor performances, ironically after a 1 - 1 home tie to Sicilian rivals and Zenga's former team, Catania, with former Lazio boss Delio Rossi being appointed at his place.
Under the tutelage of Delio Rossi, results dramatically improved, and Palermo established a record of seven consecutive home wins, and also achieved prestigious results such as two 2 - 0 wins against Italian giants Milan and Juventus.
The latter win, achieved on February, led Palermo to climb over the Bianconeri in fourth place, establishing the Rosanero as serious contenders for a Champions League spot, which they ultimately lost to Sampdoria by only one point.
Such season also launched new emerging stars such as midfielder Javier Pastore and goalkeeper Salvatore Sirigu, who went on to become integral part of their respective international teams.
The Government of Italy is in the form of a democratic republic, and was established by a constitution in 1946.

The development team sought to retain the level of fear from the original game, and introduced two characters who lacked experience with terrifying situations: Leon S. Kennedy, largely identical to his persona in the final build, and Elza Walker, a college student and motorcycle racer vacationing in Raccoon City, her hometown.
Unlike the final version, the character paths did not cross, and each character had two support partners instead of one.
Leon received help from fellow police officer Marvin Branagh and researcher Linda - an early version of Ada - while Elza was aided by Sherry Birkin and John, who appeared in Resident Evil 2 as gun shop owner Robert Kendo.
Apart from "jabol" or "jabcok", this beverage has amassed a variety of colourful slang names.

The 2006 - 07 return match between Palermo and Catania, played on 2 February 2007 at Stadio Angelo Massimino, Catania, is remembered due to the death of policeman Filippo Raciti who was injured during riots between the local police and the Catania supporters.
This event led Italian Federation commissioner Luca Pancalli to suspend all football leagues and national team events in the whole country for a couple of weeks.
In the wake of her rising popularity she was drafted to be a co-host with Beto Ortiz for the Panamericana (Channel 5) show ¡Qué Pais!, which debuted on 4 June 2007.
The short - lived show was shown every Monday night from 8 - 10, which put it in direct opposition to the ATV show "Magaly TV (ATV)".
At the end of 2015, Scott launched a collaborative YouTube channel with his colleague and friend Matt Gray called Matt & Tom, known for its series The Park Bench wherein the pair would regularly sit on a park bench and discuss videos on Scott's other channel, occasions from their past, travels, and stories related to their jobs.
The series was produced weekly from its inception until 24 March 2018, when they announced that the series would no longer be produced on a regular schedule due to time constraints.
On 30 October 2018, they officially ended the series; however, they stated that the channel would continue to be used for other projects.
Shortly thereafter, the channel became a vehicle for videos of The Technical Difficulties, including "The Experiments" (2018), where the troupe piloted a number of game show ideas.
As of 12 June 2019, it is airing their new series Two Of These People Are Lying, in which Scott has to guess which of the troupe is giving accurate information pertaining to a Wikipedia article whose title he has drawn from a pre-prepared stack.
In 1983, Nintendo opened a new production facility in Uji and was listed on the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
Uemura, taking inspiration from the ColecoVision, began creating a new video game console that would incorporate a ROM cartridge format for video games as well as both a central processing unit and a physics processing unit.
The Family Computer, or Famicom, was released in Japan in July 1983 along with three games adapted from their original arcade versions: Donkey Kong, Donkey Kong Jr. and Popeye.
Its success was such that in 1984, it surpassed the market share held by Sega's SG - 1000.
At this time, Nintendo adopted a series of guidelines that involved the validation of each game produced for the Famicom before its distribution on the market, agreements with developers to ensure that no Famicom game would be adapted to other consoles within two years of its release, and restricting developers from producing more than five games a year for the Famicom.

Meanwhile, Claire is reunited with Sherry and discovers that "G" has implanted his daughter with an embryo to produce offspring.
Leon, Ada, Claire and Sherry advance through an abandoned factory connected to Umbrella's secret underground research facility.
An attack by "G" leaves Ada heavily wounded, and Leon explores the laboratory to find something to treat her wounds.
He is interrupted by a psychotic Annette, who explains to him that Ada's relationship with John was only a means of getting information about Umbrella: Ada is a spy sent to steal the G - virus for an unknown organization.
Just as Annette is about to shoot Leon, the Tyrant appears, and she is forced to retreat.
Ada returns to save Leon and battles the Tyrant - which falls into a pit of molten metal - seemingly at the cost of her own life.
She confesses her love to Leon, who leaves behind her motionless body.
Meanwhile, Annette tries to escape with another sample of the G - virus but is fatally wounded by her mutated husband.
However, before she dies, she tells Claire how to create a vaccine that will stop the mutations caused by the embryo within Sherry.
After preparing the cure, Leon and Claire reunite at an emergency escape train and inject Sherry with the vaccine, which saves her life.
En route, Leon is assisted in terminating the now - mutated Tyrant by a woman in shadow and escapes with the G - virus in the pendant.
"G" - now mutated into an agglomeration of flesh and teeth - follows Leon and Claire, but is destroyed when the train self - destructs.
After escaping from the city with Sherry, Leon intends to take down Umbrella, while Claire continues to search for Chris.
Nintendo's South Korean subsidiary was established on 7 July 2006, and is based in Seoul.
In March 2016, the subsidiary was heavily downsized due to a corporate restructuring after analyzing shifts in the current market, laying off 80% of its employees, leaving only ten people, including CEO Hiroyuki Fukuda.
This did not affect any games scheduled for release in South Korea, and Nintendo continued operations there as usual.
Bupropion is a reuptake inhibitor and releasing agent of norepinephrine and a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist, and it activates proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons in the hypothalamus which give an effect downstream, resulting in loss of appetite and increased energy output.
The POMC is regulated by endogenous opioids via opioid - mediated negative feedback.
Naltrexone by contrast is a pure opioid antagonist, therefore further augmenting bupropion's activation of the POMC.

The GDP gap or the output gap is the difference between actual GDP or actual output and potential GDP.
The calculation for the output gap is Y - Y * where Y is actual output and Y * is potential output.
If this calculation yields a positive number it is called an inflationary gap and indicates the growth of aggregate demand is outpacing the growth of aggregate supply - possibly creating inflation; if the calculation yields a negative number it is called a recessionary gap - possibly signifying deflation.
In August 2015, Capcom announced that a remake of Resident Evil 2 was in development.

Following a 1984 study on "Injuries Due to Falling Coconuts", exaggerated claims spread concerning the number of deaths by falling coconuts.
Falling coconuts, according to urban legend, kill a few people a year. This legend gained momentum after the 2002 work of a noted expert on shark attacks was characterized as saying that falling coconuts kill 150 people each year worldwide.
This statistic has often been contrasted with the number of shark - caused deaths per year, which is around five.

Nintendo was founded as Nintendo Karuta on September 23, 1889 by craftsman Fusajiro Yamauchi in Shimogyō - ku, Kyoto, Japan, to produce and distribute hanafuda.: 14 The word Nintendo is commonly assumed to mean 'leave luck to heaven': 14, but there are no historical records to validate this assumption.
It can alternatively be translated as' the temple of free hanafuda '.
Yamauchi manufactured these playing cards using white mulberry bark, which he painted by hand.: 14 He was able to market them despite the fact that gambling had been prohibited by Japanese authorities since 1633, because the cards incorporated illustrations rather than numbers.
In 2000 Ilboudo was appointed Secretary of State for the Promotion of Human Rights.

The Burkina Faso ambassador's residence is in Denmark.
Fixed costs are a serious challenge for B&M businesses.
Fixed costs are payments that a business has to make for elements such as rent of a store and monthly payments for services such as a security alarm.
Fixed costs stay the same for a business even if it ramps up its operations or winds down its operations during a slow period.
In contrast, variable costs change as a business ramps its operations up or down.
Variable costs include wages (for employees paid by the hour) and electricity for operating machinery used by the business during its operating hours.
If a business increases its hours of operation, its hourly wages and electricity bill will rise, but its rent and security alarm costs will stay the same (assuming that the business does not add additional locations).
Start - up companies and other small businesses typically find it hard to pay all of the fixed costs that are part of their venture.
Research shows that 70% of new start up businesses fail within the first 10 years.
PtF6 can also be prepared by disproportionation of the pentafluoride (PtF5), with the tetrafluoride (PtF4) as a byproduct.

Although the company was experiencing a period of economic prosperity, the Disney cards and derived products made it dependent on the children's market.
The situation was exacerbated by the falling sales of its adult - oriented hanafuda cards caused by Japanese society gravitating toward other hobbies such as pachinko, bowling and nightly outings.
When Disney card sales began to show signs of exhaustion, Nintendo realized that it had no real alternative with which to alleviate the situation.
After the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, Nintendo's stock price plummeted to its lowest recorded level of ¥60.

Although most of the research and development is being done in Japan, there are some R&D facilities in the United States, Europe and China that are focused on developing software and hardware technologies used in Nintendo products.
Although they all are subsidiaries of Nintendo (and therefore first - party), they are often referred to as external resources when being involved in joint development processes with Nintendo's internal developers by the Japanese personal involved.
This can be seen in the Iwata asks interview series.
Nintendo Software Technology (NST) and Nintendo Technology Development (NTD) are located in Redmond, Washington, United States, while Nintendo European Research & Development (NERD) is located in Paris, France, and Nintendo Network Service Database (NSD) is located in Kyoto, Japan.

All royalties went to the Syndicate, and all correspondence with the publisher was handled through a Syndicate office.
The Syndicate was able to enlist the cooperation of libraries in hiding the ghostwriters' names; when Walter Karig, who wrote volumes eight through ten of the original Nancy Drew Mystery Stories, tried to claim rights with the Library of Congress in 1933, the Syndicate instructed the Library of Congress not to reveal the names of any Nancy Drew authors, a move with which the Library of Congress complied.
During the period of the Roman empire and late antiquity authors produced practical works such as Vitruvius' De Architectura (1st century BC) and Agricola's De Re Metallica (1556).
Medieval Scholastic philosophy generally upheld the traditional view of technology as imitation of nature.
During the Renaissance, Francis Bacon became one of the first modern authors to reflect on the impact of technology on society.
In his utopian work New Atlantis (1627), Bacon put forth an optimistic worldview in which a fictional institution (Salomon's House) uses natural philosophy and technology to extend man's power over nature - for the betterment of society, through works which improve living conditions.
The goal of this fictional foundation is "... the knowledge of causes, and secret motions of things; and the enlarging of the bounds of human empire, to the effecting of all things possible".
After a gap during World War I, the club was refounded in 1919 as Unione Sportiva Palermo, by a committee of young university students and sportsmen.
During the early 1920s, the club mainly competed in the Campionato Lega Sud, a football league in Southern Italy, reaching the semi-finals in 1924 before being knocked out by Audace Taranto, Alba Roma and Internaples.
The club was dissolved in 1927 due to financial problems, but was reformed one year later following a merger with Vigor Palermo under the name Palermo FootBall Club.
Originally admitted to Prima Divisione (First Division), the equivalent of today's Serie C1, the team was promoted into Serie B in 1930 and finally reached Serie A in 1932.
From its debut season in Italy's top division, Palermo relocated to a new home, the Stadio Littorio (Lictorian Stadium) in the Favorita neighbourhood, today known as Stadio Renzo Barbera.
The club played Serie A until 1936, when they were relegated to Serie B and first played Catania in the Sicilian derby.
Increased urban land use and occupation alters the local thermal field resulting in the development of urban heat islands.
An urban heat island is a phenomenon where the surface temperature and air are concentrated in urban areas rather than surrounding suburban / rural areas.
The solar energy absorbed and produced from solar radiation and anthropogenic activity is partitioned accordingly: warming the air above the surface via convection, evaporating moisture from the urban surface system, and storing heat in surface materials, such as buildings and roads.
The solar energy is stored during the day and typically released during the night.
Dark materials making up the buildings, impermeable soil and paved surfaces retain a majority of the solar energy.
This allows for larger heat islands and increased thermal discomfort.
Surface reflectivity in urban areas can impact ambient temperature.
When the vegetative surface is dark and dry it can reach 52 °C, whereas when the land is light and moist it reaches 18 °C.
Water evaporation usually helps to release energy from vegetative surfaces to cool the surface above.
But most hotspot locations have little greenery which influences the formation of urban heat islands.
Darker man - made surfaces have a lower albedo and heat capacity than natural surfaces allowing for increased photochemical reaction rates and absorption of visible radiation.
This phenomenon can also be exacerbated when people release waste heat via heating and ventilating systems (e.g. air conditioners) and vehicular emissions.
Expansion of these urban areas can lead to higher surface and air temperatures contributing to urban climate.

Steroids were the first immunosuppressant identified, but its side - effects limited its use, the more specific azathioprine was identified in 1960, but it was the discovery of ciclosporin in 1980 (together with azathioprine) that allowed significant expansion of transplantation to less well - matched donor - recipient pairs as well as broad application to lung transplantation, pancreas transplantation, and heart transplantation.
After an organ transplantation, the body will nearly always reject the new organ (s) due to differences in human leukocyte antigen between the donor and recipient.
As a result, the immune system detects the new tissue as "foreign", and attempts to remove it by attacking it with white blood cells, resulting in the death of the donated tissue, immunosuppressants are given as an attempt to prevent this rejection; the side - effect is that the body becomes more vulnerable to infections and malignancy.
It currently has 1,146 articles.

Beginning in the 1990s and early 2000s, many governments in industrialised countries began to offer e-government services to citizens.
Online government services are offered by a range of government departments and agencies, ranging from departments of motor vehicles (online car registration), police (paying speeding tickets online), city services (paying parking tickets online or requesting that a pothole be filled) and social services (registering for social assistance or unemployment insurance) and tax departments (paying a tax bill or submitting a tax return online).
Many governments use e-services to provide online information to citizens (e.g., "help" guides, Frequently Asked Question lists, manuals for government program applicants, etc.), thus saving on the need for call centers where citizens can call to ask questions or physical service locations where citizens can come in person to ask about government forms or services.

Secondary sex characteristics are features that appear during puberty in humans, and at sexual maturity in other animals.
These are particularly evident in the sexually dimorphic phenotypic traits that distinguish the sexes of a species, but unlike the sex organs, are not directly part of the reproductive system.
They are believed to be the product of sexual selection for traits which display fitness, giving an individual an advantage over its rivals in courtship and aggressive interactions.
They are distinguished from the primary sex characteristics, the sex organs, which are directly necessary for sexual reproduction to occur.

The root locus method can also be used for the analysis of sampled data systems by computing the root locus in the z - plane, the discrete counterpart of the s - plane.
The equation z = esT maps continuous s - plane poles (not zeros) into the z - domain, where T is the sampling period.
The stable, left half s - plane maps into the interior of the unit circle of the z - plane, with the s - plane origin equating to | z | = 1 (becausee0 = 1).
A diagonal line of constant damping in the s - plane maps around a spiral from (1,0) in the z plane as it curves in toward the origin.
Note also that the Nyquist aliasing criteria is expressed graphically in the z - plane by the x-axis, where ωnT = π.
The line of constant damping just described spirals in indefinitely but in sampled data systems, frequency content is aliased down to lower frequencies by integral multiples of the Nyquist frequency.
That is, the sampled response appears as a lower frequency and better damped as well since the root in the z - plane maps equally well to the first loop of a different, better damped spiral curve of constant damping.
Many other interesting and relevant mapping properties can be described, not least that z - plane controllers, having the property that they may be directly implemented from the z - plane transfer function (zero / pole ratio of polynomials), can be imagined graphically on a z - plane plot of the open loop transfer function, and immediately analyzed utilizing root locus.

Abyssal fans, also known as deep - sea fans, underwater deltas, and submarine fans, are underwater geological structures associated with large - scale sediment deposition and formed by turbidity currents.
They can be thought of as an underwater version of alluvial fans and can vary dramatically in size, with widths from several kilometres to several thousands of kilometres. The largest is the Bengal Fan, followed by the Indus Fan, but major fans are also found at the outlet of the Amazon, Congo, Mississippi and elsewhere.

The Gorce range is dominated by arched peaks and river valleys which cut into the range.
There are a few small caves and obviously - several peaks such as Turbacz (the highest - 1310 meters above sea level), Jaworzyna Kamienicka, Kiczora, Kudłoń, Czoło Turbacza and Gorc Kamienicki.
Waters cover only 0.18 km ² of park's area - there are no lakes or big rivers, only streams.
Today, paraldehyde is sometimes used to treat status epilepticus.
Unlike diazepam and other benzodiazepines, it does not suppress breathing at therapeutic doses and so is safer when no resuscitation facilities exist or when the patient's breathing is already compromised.
This makes it a useful emergency medication for parents and other caretakers of children with epilepsy.
Since the dose margin between the anticonvulsant and hypnotic effect is small, paraldehyde treatment usually results in sleep.

Nicolalde made her first foray into politics when she was elected to the National Congress of Ecuador in the 2006 legislative elections, representing the Patriotic Society Party.
She was dismissed from her position by the Supreme Electoral Tribunal during the 2007 legislative crisis at the request of President Rafael Correa in order to establish the Ecuadorian Constituent Assembly.
In 2009, Nicolalde emerged as a primary candidate for the Mayor of Guayaquil for the Patriotic Society Party, and she announced her intention to run.
However, the PSP denied any support for Nicolalde, instead backing Jaime Nebot for reelection.
In addition to determining the stability of the system, the root locus can be used to design the damping ratio (ζ) and natural frequency (ωn) of a feedback system.
Lines of constant damping ratio can be drawn radially from the origin and lines of constant natural frequency can be drawn as arcs whose center points coincide with the origin. By selecting a point along the root locus that coincides with a desired damping ratio and natural frequency, a gain K can be calculated and implemented in the controller.
More elaborate techniques of controller design using the root locus are available in most control textbooks: for instance, lag, lead, PI, PD and PID controllers can be designed approximately with this technique.
In 1997, Simon & Schuster announced a mass cancellation of Nancy Drew and Hardy Boys spin - offs, except ones for younger children.

Benedetto Croce (Italian:; 25 February 1866 - 20 November 1952) was an Italian idealist philosopher, historian and politician, who wrote on numerous topics, including philosophy, history, historiography and aesthetics.
In most regards, Croce was a liberal, although he opposed laissez - faire free trade and had considerable influence on other Italian intellectuals, including both Marxist Antonio Gramsci and fascist Giovanni Gentile.
Croce was President of PEN International, the worldwide writers' association, from 1949 until 1952.
He was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature sixteen times.
Novell, Inc. / noʊˈvɛl / was a software and services company headquartered in Provo, Utah.
Its most significant product was the multi-platform network operating system known as Novell NetWare, which became the dominant form of personal computer networking during the second half of the 1980s and first half of the 1990s.
Novell technology contributed to the emergence of local area networks, which displaced the dominant mainframe computing model and changed computing worldwide.
Novell became instrumental in making Utah Valley a focus for technology and software development.
On 13 July 2012, Palermo fans were recognised as the fairest in the 2011 - 12 season, winning the Fair Play Trophy "Gaetano Scirea" established by the Council of the Serie A.
Only a few assets from Resident Evil 1.5 could be recycled, as the principal locations in the final build were made to look more extravagant and artistic, based on photographs taken of the interiors of Western - style buildings in Japanese cities.
These environments were created with a software program called O2, and each background took two to three weeks to render.
The maximum number of zombies displayed on the screen at one time was limited to seven, making it possible to use 450 polygons for the comparatively detailed models of Leon and Claire.
The protagonists, instead of being given visible wounds, were made to limp slowly upon receiving heavy damage.
Apart from the graphics, one of the most important new features was the "Zapping System", which was partly inspired by Back to the Future Part II, a time travel - themed film sequel that offers a different perspective on the story of the original film.
The voice - overs by the all - Canadian cast of Resident Evil 2 were recorded before the actual cutscenes were completed, with each of the actors selected from a roster of ten people per role.
Thereafter, the full - motion videos (FMVs) were created by filming stop motion animations of action figures, which were then rendered to completed pictures with computer graphics (CG) tools.
Ada's movie model could not be finished in time.
Thus, she is the only main character not to appear in a pre-rendered cutscene.
Fenethazine (INN) (brand names Anergen, Contralergial, Ethysine, Etisine, Lisergan, Lysergan; former developmental code names RP - 3015, SC - 1627, WY - 1143), or phenethazine, is a first - generation antihistamine of the phenothiazine group.
Promethazine, and subsequently chlorpromazine, were derived from fenethazine.
Fenethazine, in turn, was derived from phenbenzamine.
Orexigen submitted a New Drug Application (NDA) for this drug combination to the FDA On 31 March 2010. Having paid a fee under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, Orexigen was given a deadline for the FDA to approve or reject the drug of 31 January 2011.
On 7 December 2010, an FDA Advisory Committee voted 13 - 7 for the approval of Contrave, and voted 11 - 8 for the conduct of a post-marketing cardiovascular outcomes study.
Subsequently, on 2 February 2011, the FDA rejected the drug and it was decided that an extremely large - scale study of the long - term cardiovascular effects of Contrave would be needed, before approval could be considered.
It was ultimately approved in the United States in the fall of 2014.
As a survival horror game, Resident Evil 2 features the same basic gameplay mechanics as its predecessor, Resident Evil.
The player explores a fictional city while solving puzzles and fighting monsters.
The game's two protagonists may be equipped with firearms, but limited ammunition adds a tactical element to weapon use.
On the status screen, the player can check the condition of the protagonists, use medicine to heal their wounds, and assign weapons.
The characters' current health can also be determined by their posture and movement speed.
For example, a character will hold their stomach in pain if wounded, and will limp slowly if on the verge of death.
The protagonists may carry a limited number of items, and must store others in boxes placed throughout the game world, where they may later be retrieved.
Each protagonist is joined by a support partner during the course of the story.
These characters accompany the player in certain scenes, and occasionally become playable.
Certain rooms contain typewriters that the player may use to save the game.
However, each save expends one of a limited number of ink ribbons, which the player must collect in the game world.
The graphics of Resident Evil 2 are composed of real - time generated - and thus movable - polygonal character and item models, superimposed over pre-rendered backgrounds that are viewed from fixed camera angles.
The game uses tank controls, meaning that pressing up moves the character in the direction they face, down reverses them, and left and right rotates them, regardless of the perspective of the camera.

Harriet Adams continued to oversee the series, after switching publishers to Simon & Schuster, until her death in 1982.
After her death, Adams' protégés, Nancy Axelrad and Lilo Wuenn, and her three children, oversaw production of the Nancy Drew books and other Stratemeyer Syndicate series.
In 1985, the five sold the Syndicate and all rights to Simon & Schuster.
Simon & Schuster turned to book packager Mega-Books for new writers.
These books continued to have the characters solve mysteries in the present day, while still containing the same basic formula and style of the books during the Syndicate.
The philosophy of technology is a philosophical field dedicated to studying the nature of technology and its social effects.
While at Hush Hush, she sometimes would be asked into the studio, and as the technicians played their instruments, she sang along, songs she had created.
These were songs she would usually sing to herself with no serious intention of pursuing a music career.
While working part - time at Hush Hush Studios, she secured another job, at Metro TV as the only digital video editor and also producer for 'Smash TV', a weekend entertainment programme.
Lani Minella voiced the Nancy character from Secrets Can Kill in 1998 up to Sea of Darkness in 2015.
Waiswa's work explores what she calls a "New African Identity": how younger generations of Africans feel more expressive and less restrained by tradition than their predecessors.
She also sought to counteract stereotypical depictions of Africa, often the result of foreign rather than native photographers.
Additionally, many of her subjects are women.
The main addition over the preceding game is the "Zapping System", by which each of the two playable characters are confronted with different puzzles and storylines in their respective scenarios.
After finishing the "A" scenario with one protagonist, a "B" scenario, in which the events are depicted from the other character's perspective, is unlocked.
The player has the option of starting the "A" scenario with either of the two protagonists, resulting in a total of four different scenarios.
For example, the availability of certain items may be altered.
After each game, the player receives a ranking based on the total time taken to complete the scenario, and on the number of saves and special healing items used.
Depending on the player's accomplishments, bonus weapons and costumes may be unlocked as a reward.
The original version of Resident Evil 2 contains two stand - alone minigames: "The 4th Survivor" and "The To - fu Survivor".
In both of these minigames, the player must reach the goal while fighting every enemy along the way with only the default item loadout.
All later versions (except the Nintendo 64 version) add a third minigame, "Extreme Battle", which consists of four playable characters and three stages.
For this system, the overall transfer function is given by
Abyssal (or submarine) fans are formed from turbidity currents.
According to commentators, the cultural impact of Nancy Drew has been enormous.
The immediate success of the series led directly to the creation of numerous other girls' mysteries series, such as The Dana Girls mystery stories and the Kay Tracey mystery stories, and the phenomenal sales of the character Edward Stratemeyer feared was "too flip" encouraged publishers to market many other girls' mystery series, such as the Judy Bolton Series, and to request authors of series such as the Cherry Ames Nurse Stories to incorporate mystery elements into their works.
The quantum of evidence is the amount of evidence needed; the quality of proof is how reliable such evidence should be considered.
Important rules that govern admissibility concern hearsay, authentication, relevance, privilege, witnesses, opinions, expert testimony, identification and rules of physical evidence.
There are various standards of evidence or standards showing how strong the evidence must be to meet the legal burden of proof in a given situation, ranging from reasonable suspicion to preponderance of the evidence, clear and convincing evidence, or beyond a reasonable doubt.
Dexlansoprazole was approved for medical use in the United States in 2009.

Before a specialty in personal finance was developed, various disciplines which are closely related to it, such as family economics, and consumer economics were taught in various colleges as part of home economics for over 100 years.
The earliest known research in personal finance was done in 1920 by Hazel Kyrk.
Her dissertation at University of Chicago laid the foundation of consumer economics and family economics.
Margaret Reid, a professor of Home Economics at the same university, is recognized as one of the pioneers in the study of consumer behavior and Household behavior.
Nancy Drew Diaries started in 2013.
This is a reboot of the Nancy Drew: Girl Detective series.
The series is described as "A classic Nancy Drew with her modern twist".
The mystery element is not always the main focus of the characters, and often Nancy states she is avoiding mysteries or "on a break" from sleuthing.
Nancy often acts timid and scared, in book # 16 The Haunting on Heliotrope Lane she says she is glad she "has n't peed herself from being scared".
This Nancy does not navigate in the world of adults as previous versions of the character.
The first person narration reveals a juvenile voice with a passive role in the action and a lack of motivation in solving mysteries.
In book # 12 The Sign in the Smoke Nancy does not solve the mystery, a secondary character comes up with the solution.
In several books Nancy stumbles upon the solution to the "mystery" and acts amazed at the reveal.
This is in contrast to the set - up of previous Nancy Drew series.
Attempts to make Nancy's character more modern and less perfect have resulted in a confusing and often conflicting representation of the iconic Nancy Drew character.
Since the volume of the parcel is larger than the surrounding air after LFC by the ideal gas law (PV = nRT), it is less dense and becomes buoyant rising until its temperature (at E) equals the surrounding airmass.
If the airmass has one or many LFC, it is potentially unstable and may lead to convective clouds like cumulus and thunderstorms.
The Nibelungenlied was the first heroic epic put into writing in Germany, helping to found a larger genre of written heroic poetry.
The poem's tragedy appears to have bothered its medieval audience, and very early on a sequel was written, the Nibelungenklage, which made the tragedy less final.
The poem was forgotten after around 1500, but was rediscovered in 1755.
Dubbed the "German Iliad", the Nibelungenlied began a new life as the German national epic.
The poem was appropriated for nationalist purposes and was heavily used in anti-democratic, reactionary, and National - Socialist propaganda before and during the Second World War.
Its legacy today is most visible in Richard Wagner's operatic cycle Der Ring des Nibelungen, which, however, is mostly based on Old Norse sources.
In 2009, the three main manuscripts of the Nibelungenlied were inscribed in UNESCO's Memory of the World Register in recognition of their historical significance.
It has been called "one of the most impressive, and certainly the most powerful, of the German epics of the Middle Ages."
Between 1963 and 1968, Yamauchi invested in several business lines for Nintendo that were far from its traditional market and, for the most part, were unsuccessful.
Among these ventures were packages of instant rice, a chain of love hotels, and a taxi service named Daiya.
Although the taxi service was better received than the previous efforts, Yamauchi rejected this initiative after a series of disagreements with local unions.
Mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) is a milk - transmitted retrovirus like the HTL viruses, HI viruses, and BLV.
It belongs to the genus Betaretrovirus.
Bittner established the theory that a cancerous agent, or "milk factor", could be transmitted by cancerous mothers to young mice from a virus in their mother's milk.
The majority of mammary tumors in mice are caused by mouse mammary tumor virus.

Resident Evil 2 is a survival horror game developed and published by Capcom and released for the PlayStation in 1998.
The player controls Leon S. Kennedy and Claire Redfield, who must escape Raccoon City after its citizens are transformed into zombies by a biological weapon two months after the events of the original Resident Evil.
The gameplay focuses on exploration, puzzles, and combat; the main difference from its predecessor are the branching paths, with each player character having unique storylines and obstacles.
The hill of Corton has been known for more than a millennium for the quality of its "terroirs" and perfect orientation.
To honour the Maison's rich history, the flagship "Château Corton Grancey" Grand Cru is made, which is entirely unique to Louis Latour and is only produced in the best vintages.
It is a blend of four areas of Domaine Latour Corton Grand Cru: Les Bressandes, Les Perrières, Les Grèves and Clos du Roi.
One of Novell's major innovations at the time was Novell Directory Services (NDS), now known as eDirectory.
Introduced with NetWare 4.0 in 1993, NDS replaced the old Bindery server and user management technology employed by NetWare 3.x and earlier.
Stratemeyer initially pitched the new series to Hardy Boys publishers Grosset & Dunlap as the "Stella Strong Stories", adding that "they might also be called 'Diana Drew Stories', 'Diana Dare Stories', 'Nan Nelson Stories', 'Nan Drew Stories', or 'Helen Hale Stories'." Editors at Grosset & Dunlap preferred "Nan Drew" of these options, but decided to lengthen "Nan" to "Nancy". Stratemeyer accordingly began writing plot outlines and hired Mildred Wirt, later Mildred Wirt Benson, to ghostwrite the first volumes in the series under the pseudonym Carolyn Keene.
Subsequent titles have been written by a number of different ghostwriters, all under the pseudonym Carolyn Keene.
The President of the Republic is elected for seven years by Parliament in joint session, together with three representatives of each region, except for the Aosta Valley, which gets only one representative.
These delegates are elected by their respective Regional Councils so as to guarantee representation to minorities.
The election needs a wide majority that is progressively reduced from two - thirds to one - half plus one of the votes after the third ballot.
The only Presidents ever to be elected on the first ballot are Francesco Cossiga and Carlo Azeglio Ciampi.
Ciampi was replaced by Giorgio Napolitano, who was elected on 10 May 2006.
While it is not forbidden by law, no President had ever served two terms until 20 April 2013, when President Giorgio Napolitano was reelected.
The history of brick and mortar businesses can not be dated precisely, but it existed in the earliest vendor stalls in the first towns, where merchants brought their agricultural produce, clay pots and handmade clothing to sell in a village market.
Bricks and mortar businesses remain important in the 2010s, though many shops and services, ranging from consumer electronics shops to clothing shops and even grocery shops have begun offering online shopping.
This physical presence, either of a retail shop, a customer service location with staff, where clients can go in person to ask questions about a product or service, or a service center or repair facility where customers can bring their products, has played a crucial role in providing goods and services to consumers throughout history.
Nancy becomes much more respectful of male authority figures in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, leading some to claim that the revised Nancy simply becomes too agreeable, and less distinctive, writing of her, "In the revised books, Nancy is relentlessly upbeat, puts up with her father's increasingly protective tendencies, and, when asked if she goes to church in the 1969 The Clue of the Tapping Heels, replies, 'As often as I can'... Nancy learns to hold her tongue; she does n't sass the dumb cops like she used to."
Maison Louis Latour is an important négociant - éléveur of red and white wines in Burgundy, France.

Theoretically, four stereoisomeric structures are possible.
The structures (1) and (2) are known as cis - and trans - paraldehyde.
The structures (3) (a conformer of (2)) and (4) (a conformer of (1)) do n't exist for steric reasons.
In 1980, Harriet Adams switched publishers to Simon & Schuster, dissatisfied with the lack of creative control at Grosset & Dunlap and the lack of publicity for the Hardy Boys' 50th anniversary in 1977.
Grosset & Dunlap filed suit against the Syndicate and the new publishers, Simon & Schuster, citing "breach of contract, copyright infringement, and unfair competition."
A port of Resident Evil 2 for the Sega Saturn was developed internally at Capcom for a time, but technical difficulties led to its cancellation in October 1998.
Tiger Electronics released a sprite - based 2.5 D version for their Game.com handheld in late 1998.
It included only Leon's story path, and removed several of the original game's core features.
In February 2013, an unfinished build of Resident Evil 1.5 was leaked onto the Internet.
In Italy, Resident Evil 2 was temporarily banned in 1999 following criticism from the political organization "Movimento Diritti Civili" (Civil Rights Movement) for its realistic depiction of violence, with the law enforcement agency Guardia di Finanza seizing over 5,500 unsold copies.
After Sony Computer Entertainment asked for a re-examination of the seizure decree, the ban was lifted a few months later.

Prior to establishing Quincy Herbals, she was a secretary at Societe Generale Bank Nigeria Limited where she later became the personal assistant to the managing director of the bank.
In 1959, Nintendo entered into an agreement with Walt Disney to incorporate his company's animated characters into the cards.
Nintendo also developed a distribution system that allowed it to offer its products in toy stores.
By 1961, the company had sold more than 1.5 million card packs and held a high market share, for which it relied on televised advertising campaigns.
The need for diversification led the company to list stock on the second section of the Osaka and Kyoto stock exchanges, in addition to becoming a public company and changing its name to Nintendo Co., Ltd. in 1963.
In 1964, Nintendo earned an income of ¥150 million.
Major research interests
The last rule was circumvented in a number of ways; for example, Konami, wanting to produce more games for Nintendo's consoles, formed Ultra Games and later Palcom to produce more games as a technically different publisher.
This disadvantaged smaller or emerging companies, as they could not afford to start additional companies.
In another side effect, Square Co (now Square Enix) executives have suggested that the price of publishing games on the Nintendo 64 along with the degree of censorship and control that Nintendo enforced over its games, most notably Final Fantasy VI, were factors in switching its focus towards Sony's PlayStation console.
Nancy is frequently portrayed pursuing a suspect, examining a clue, or observing action.
She is often also shown in peril: being chased, falling off a boat, or hanging by a rope from rafters.
These covers are "characterized by frenetic energy on Nancy's part; whether she is falling, limbs flailing, an alarmed look on her face, or whether she is running, hair flying, body bent, face breathless.
Nancy does not have any control over the events that are happening in these covers. She is shown to be a victim, being hunted and attacked by unseen foes.
Khawaja Ghulam Farid (1845 - 1901; his famous collection is Deewan - e-Farid) and Sachal Sar Mast (1739 - 1829) are the most celebrated Sufi poets in Saraiki and their poems known as Kafi are still famous.
At the 2007 election, Melbourne became a marginal seat for the first time, with the Greens candidate Adam Bandt taking second place on a two candidate preferred basis, leaving Labor with 54.71 percent of the vote.

The main Nancy Drew series, The Nancy Drew Files, and Girl Detective books have been translated into a number of languages besides English. Estimates vary from between 14 and 25languages, but 25 seems the most accurate number.
Nancy Drew books have been published in many European countries (especially in Nordic countries and France) as well as in Latin America and Asia. The character of Nancy Drew seems to be more popular in some countries than others.
Nancy Drew books have been in print in Norway since 1941 (the first country outside USA), in Denmark since 1958, in France since 1955 and in Italy since 1970 by Arnoldo Mondadori Editore.
Other countries, such as Estonia, have only recently begun printing Nancy Drew books.
The Zamparini era: back to Serie A and European years (2002 - 2013)
Historically, traders or bookkeepers wrote in a script known as kiṛakkī or laṇḍā, although use of this script has been significantly reduced in recent times.
Likewise, a script related to the Landa scripts family, known as Multani, was previously used to write Saraiki.
A preliminary proposal to encode the Multani script in ISO / IEC 10646 was submitted in 2011.
Saraiki Unicode has been approved in 2005.
The Khojiki script has also been in use, whereas Devanagari and Gurmukhi are not employed anymore.
The first season originally alternated with the Hardy Boys; the Hardy Boys was met with success, but the Drew episodes were met with mixed results.
In the second season, the format shifted to present the Hardy Boys as the more prominent characters, with Nancy Drew mostly a character in crossover episodes (although the character did have some solo episodes).

Pat trains with Tiffany and performs in a dance competition with her. After the contest, Tiffany agrees to be a go between and gives Pat a letter, supposedly written by Nikki.
Pat suggests a meeting with Nikki at the place they got engaged, and despite no reply he slips away from his family on Christmas Day to meet her.
Nikki is not there; Tiffany is, and admits she has forged Nikki's letters and that she had been trying to help Pat move on and gain closure with his marriage because she, Tiffany, is in love with Pat.
Pat is furious that the last two months of correspondence were a lie.
In shock Pat runs into an unfamiliar neighborhood and is assaulted.
By chance, he encounters Danny, his friend from the Baltimore mental health facility.
Danny helps Pat get to a hospital and reunite him with his family.
Pat still does not recall how or why he was separated from his wife, and only when he watches the wedding video which his mother had hidden, do the memories eventually return - with the realization that he and Nikki will never be reunited.

The primary component of this binary star system has a stellar classification of B9 .5 III, with the luminosity class of III suggesting this is an evolved giant star that has exhausted the supply of hydrogen at its core.
The interferometry - measured angular diameter of this star, after correcting for limb darkening, is 1.44 ± 0.06 mas, which, at its estimated distance, equates to a physical radius of about 6.8 times the radius of the Sun.
This is a close match to the empirically - determined value of 6.9 solar radii. It has about 3.5 times the mass of the Sun and is radiating around 363 times the Sun's luminosity from its outer atmosphere at an effective temperature of 9,960 K.
At this heat, the star glows with a blue - white hue.

Immunosuppressants may be prescribed when a normal immune response is undesirable, such as in autoimmune diseases.
Customer service: face - to - face customer service can be a big contributor into increasing sales of a business and improving customer satisfaction.
When customers can take a product back to the store to ask staff questions or help them learn to use it, it can make customers feel more satisfied with their purchase.
Research has shown that 86% of customers will pay more for a product if they have received great customer service.
Face - to - face interaction: Many consumers prefer to be able to touch products, and experience and test them out before they buy.
This is often attributed to Baby Boomers, older Generation X customers and the elderly being used to a more traditional in - person approach when it comes to shopping and preferring to have a demonstration of products or services, especially when buying new technology. Other studies show, given equal prices, a 90% preference for the in - person shopping experience, including among teens, who combine social interaction with shopping.
On the other hand, many of these consumers engage in showrooming: trying on clothes or otherwise examining merchandise in - store, and then buying online at cheaper prices.

A steam locomotive is a railway locomotive that produces its pulling power through a steam engine.
These locomotives are fueled by burning combustible material - usually coal / coke, wood, or oil - to produce steam in a boiler.
The steam moves reciprocating pistons which are mechanically connected to the locomotive's main wheels (drivers).
Both fuel and water supplies are carried with the locomotive, either on the locomotive itself or in wagons (tenders) pulled behind.
The first steam locomotive, made by Richard Trevithick, first operated on 21 February 1804, three years after the road locomotive he made in 1801.

A prominent critic of the Nancy Drew character, at least the Nancy of these early Nancy Drew stories, is mystery writer Bobbie Ann Mason.
Mason also criticizes the series for its racism and classism, arguing that Nancy is the upper - class WASP defender of a "fading aristocracy, threatened by the restless lower classes."
Mason further contends that the "most appealing elements of these daredevil girl sleuth adventure books are (secretly) of this kind: tea and fancy cakes, romantic settings, food eaten in quaint places (never a Ho-Jo's), delicious pauses that refresh, old - fashioned picnics in the woods, precious jewels and heirlooms....

As of 2001, the secondary companion is located at an angular separation of 2.392 arcseconds from the primary along a position angle of 142.3 °.
At the distance of this system, this angle is equivalent to a physical separation of about 106AU, which places it inside the debris disk.
It is a main sequence star with about 95% of the mass of the Sun.
The system has a higher optical linear polarisation than expected for its distance from the Sun; this has been attributed to light scattered off the disk from the secondary. Prior to its 1993 identification using an adaptive optics coronagraph, this companion may have been responsible for the spectral anomalies that were attributed to the primary star.

Support for Palermo is closely associated with a strong sense of belonging to Sicily; indeed, it is not uncommon to see Sicilian flags waved by fans and ultras during Palermo matches.
Palermo fans are also twinned with Lecce ultras.
The latter was even more strengthened in recent times by the acquisition of Fabrizio Miccoli, who is originally from the outskirts of Lecce and a well - known supporter of the local team, who went on to become a key player and captain for the Sicilians.

The Schmidt camera was invented by German - Estonian optician Bernhard Schmidt in 1930.
Its optical components are an easy - to - make spherical primary mirror, and an aspherical correcting lens, known as a Schmidt corrector plate, located at the center of curvature of the primary mirror.
The film or other detector is placed inside the camera, at the prime focus.
The design is noted for allowing very fast focal ratios, while controlling coma and astigmatism.
The 2004 - 05 season, the first in Serie A for the Palermo club since 1973, ended with an excellent sixth place, securing qualification for the 2005 - 06 UEFA Cup for the first time in its history.
Luca Toni broke the Palermo Serie A scoring record by notching up 20 league goals.
Guidolin left in 2005 and was replaced by Luigi Delneri, who did not manage to repeat his predecessor's successes and was later replaced by Giuseppe Papadopulo.
Despite an unimpressive eighth place in the Serie A table, Palermo reached the last 16 in the UEFA Cup as well as the Coppa Italia semi-finals.
Guidolin's return was followed by Palermo being admitted to play UEFA Cup again due to the 2006 Serie A scandal and Palermo players Andrea Barzagli, Cristian Zaccardo, Simone Barone and Fabio Grosso being crowned 2006 World Cup winners.
A number of impressive signings were made to establish an ambitious team, and a good beginning in the 2006 - 07 campaign appeared initially to confirm this.
An 11 - game winless streak, however, forced Palermo to fall down from third to seventh place, ending the season in fifth place and ensuring another UEFA Cup qualification.

Many feminist critics have pondered the reason for the character's iconic status.
Nancy's car, and her skill in driving and repairing it, are often cited.
Melanie Rehak points to Nancy's famous blue roadster (now a blue hybrid) as a symbol of "ultimate freedom and independence".
Not only does Nancy have the freedom to go where she pleases (a freedom other, similar characters such as The Dana Girls do not have), but she is also able to change a tire and fix a flawed distributor, prompting Paretsky to argue that in "a nation where car mechanics still mock or brush off complaints by women Nancy remains a significant role model."
Supernova impostors appear as remarkably faint supernovae of spectral type IIn - which have hydrogen in their spectrum and narrow spectral lines that indicate relatively low gas speeds.
These impostors exceed their pre-outburst states by several magnitudes, with typical peak absolute visual magnitudes of - 11 to - 14, making these outbursts as bright as the most luminous stars.
The trigger mechanism of these outbursts remains unexplained, though it is thought to be caused by violating the classical Eddington luminosity limit, initiating severe mass loss.
If the ratio of radiated energy to kinetic energy is near unity, as in Eta Carinae, then we might expect an ejected mass of about 0.16 solar masses.
Ilboudo was one of the women portrayed by Anne - Laure Folly in her 1994 documentary Femmes aux yeux ouverts (Women with open eyes).
The title of the film is from a poem that Ilboudo reads, which says: "A respectable woman should learn from her husband, she should n't read, she should n't have her eyes open." Ilboudo explains that in Burkina Faso, as in many African societies, men retain control over sexual relations.
Procreation is the main factor, rather than love.
Polygamy with the goal of reproduction and casual unprotected sex by the men exposes the women to a high risk of HIV / AIDS.
Ilboudo summarizes the dilemma: "You ca n't take precautions to have kids!"
A good example of an umbrella species and its impact is summed up by Kimberly Andrews, a University of Georgia doctoral student at the Savannah River Ecology Laboratory:

Each sweat gland receives several nerve fibers that branch out into bands of one or more axons and encircle the individual tubules of the secretory coil.
Capillaries are also interwoven among sweat tubules.
Third, a persistent, large output gap can have deleterious effects on a country's public finances.
This is partially because a struggling economy with a weak labor market results in forgone tax revenue, as unemployed or underemployed workers are either paying no income taxes, or paying less in income taxes than they would if fully employed.
Additionally, a higher incidence of unemployment increases public spending on safety - net programs (in the United States, these include unemployment insurance, food stamps, Medicaid, and the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program).
Reduced tax revenue and increased public spending both exacerbate budget deficits.
Indeed, research has found that for each dollar U.S. gross domestic product moves away from potential output, U.S. cyclical budget deficits increase 37 cents.

Concern about the risk of fatality due to gravity's pull on coconuts led local officials in Queensland, Australia to remove coconut trees from beaches in 2002.
One newspaper dubbed coconuts "the killer fruit."
Historical reports of actual death by coconut nonetheless date back to the 1770s.
Coconuts also played a lethal role in the South Pacific during World War II.
According to published accounts, Japanese forces weaponized the tropical fruit by turning them into "coconut bombs" filled with acid and a hand grenade.

In 1883, an earthquake occurred in the village of Casamicciola on the island of Ischia near Naples, where he was on holiday with his family, destroying the home they lived in.
His mother, father, and only sister were all killed, while he was buried for a long time and barely survived.
After the earthquake he inherited his family's fortune and - much like Schopenhauer - was able to live the rest of his life in relative leisure, devoting a great deal of time to philosophy as an independent intellectual writing from his palazzo in Naples (Ryn, 2000: xi).
Palermo originally played with red and blue as its official colours since its foundation in 1898, but decided to switch to the current choice of pink and black on 27 February 1907, contemporaneously with the change of denomination to Palermo FootBall Club.

The compound was first isolated by Salimuzzaman Siddiqui in 1931 from the roots of Rauvolfia serpentina.
He named it ajmaline, after Hakim Ajmal Khan, one of the most illustrious practitioners of Unani medicine in South Asia.
Ajmaline can be found in most species of the genus Rauvolfia as well as Catharanthus roseus.
In addition to Southeast Asia, Rauvolfia species have also been found in tropical regions of India, Africa, South America, and some oceanic islands.
Other indole alkaloids found in Rauvolfia include reserpine, ajmalicine, serpentine, corynanthine, and yohimbine.
While 86 alkaloids have been discovered throughout Rauvolfia vomitoria, ajmaline is mainly isolated from the stem bark and roots of the plant.
Second, the longer a sizable output gap persists, the more damage will be inflicted on an economy's long - term potential through what economists term "hysteresis effects."
In essence, workers and capital remaining idle for long stretches due to an economy operating below its capacity can cause long - lasting damage to workers and the broader economy.
For example, the longer jobless workers remain unemployed, the more their skills and professional networks can atrophy, potentially rendering these workers unemployable.
For the United States, this concern is especially salient given that the long - term unemployment rate - the share of the unemployed who have been out of work for more than six months - stood at 36.9 percent in September 2013. Also, an underperforming economy can result in reduced investments in areas that pay dividends over the long term, such as education, and research and development.
Bąsze (German: Bonschen) is a village in the administrative district of Gmina Bartoszyce, within Bartoszyce County, Warmian - Masurian Voivodeship, in northern Poland, close to the border with the Kaliningrad Oblast of Russia.
Ajmaline (also known by trade names Gilurytmal, Ritmos, and Aritmina) is an alkaloid that is classed as a, 1 - A antiarrhythmic agent.

Five prominent 20th - century philosophers to directly address the effects of modern technology on humanity were John Dewey, Martin Heidegger, Herbert Marcuse, Günther Anders and Hannah Arendt.
They all saw technology as central to modern life, although Heidegger, Anders, Arendt and Marcuse were more ambivalent and critical than Dewey.
The problem for Heidegger was the hidden nature of technology's essence, Gestell or Enframing which posed for humans what he called its greatest danger and thus its greatest possibility.
Heidegger's major work on technology is found in The Question Concerning Technology.

Cities usually have a lower relative humidity than the surrounding air because cities are hotter, and rainwater in cities is unable to be absorbed into the ground to be released into the air by evaporation, and transpiration does not occur because cities have little vegetation.
Surface runoff is usually taken up directly into the subterranean sewage water system and thus vanishes from the surface immediately.
Better understanding of urban temperature and water vapor contributions and / or loss will reveal the reasons for lower relative humidity within cities, especially since relative humidity is dependent on temperature changes.

The wet season ends during the summer when the subtropical ridge becomes strong enough to push this front north of the region.
The concept of an umbrella species is further utilized to create wildlife corridors with what are termed focal species.
These focal species are chosen for a number of reasons and fall into several types, generally measured by their potential for an umbrella effect.
By carefully choosing species based on this criterion, a linked or networked habitat can be created from single - species corridors.
These criteria are determined with the assistance of geographic information systems on the larger scale.
Regardless of the location or scale of conservation, the umbrella effect is a measurement of a species' impact on others and is an important part of determining an approach.

A pulmonary lobule is the portion of the lung ventilated by one bronchiole.
Bronchioles are approximately 1 mm or less in diameter and their walls consist of ciliated cuboidal epithelium and a layer of smooth muscle.
Bronchioles divide into even smaller bronchioles, called terminal, which are 0.5 mm or less in diameter.
Terminal bronchioles in turn divide into smaller respiratory bronchioles which divide into alveolar ducts.
Terminal bronchioles mark the end of the conducting division of air flow in the respiratory system while respiratory bronchioles are the beginning of the respiratory division where gas exchange takes place.

The rainy season is between June and mid-July.
It is caused by hot and humid high pressure forming in the Sea of Okhotsk due to the North Pacific anticyclone combining with Asiatic continental high pressure.
When the two meteorological events meet they form a long jangmajeonseon (Hanja: 장마前線).
Beginning in late - May, the North Pacific high pressure forces the weaker continental anticyclone south of the island of Okinawa.
This fall to the south then reverses and gradually strengthens as it moves northwards back towards the Korean peninsula.

Some see in Nancy's adventures a mythic quality.
Nancy often explores secret passages, prompting Nancy Pickard to argue that Nancy Drew is a figure equivalent to the ancient Sumerian deity Inanna and that Nancy's "journeys into the 'underground'" are, in psychological terms, explorations of the unconscious.
As of 13 October 2017, nine countries have confirmed their intentions to participate in the contest.
In 1919, Grierson maintained that the dialects of what is now the southwest of Punjab Province in Pakistan constitute a dialect cluster, which he designated "Southern Lahnda" within a putative "Lahnda language".
Subsequent Indo - Aryanist linguists have confirmed the reality of this dialect cluster, even while rejecting the name "Southern Lahnda" along with the entity "Lahnda" itself.
Grierson also maintained that "Lahnda" was his novel designation for various dialects up to then called "Western Punjabi", spoken north, west, and south of Lahore.
The local dialect of Lahore is the Majhi dialect of Punjabi, which has long been the basis of standard literary Punjabi.
However, outside of Indo - Aryanist circles, the concept of "Lahnda" is still found in compilations of the world's languages (e.g. Ethnologue).
The music for Resident Evil 2 was composed by Masami Ueda, Shusaku Uchiyama and Syun Nishigaki, with one track composed by Naoshi Mizuta.
The compositions were meant to convey "desperation" as their underlying theme.
In his role as lead composer, Ueda provided the motifs, while Uchiyama was responsible for the horror - themed music used for the investigation and movie scenes.
The main theme of the score, a versatile three - note leitmotif, appears several times throughout the course of the story, being included in compositions such as "Prologue", "Raccoon City" and "The Third Malformation of G".

Nancy Drew is a fictional character, a sleuth in an American mystery series created by publisher Edward Stratemeyer as the female counterpart to his Hardy Boys series.
The character first appeared in 1930.
The books are ghostwritten by a number of authors and published under the collective pseudonym Carolyn Keene.
The books were extensively revised and shortened, beginning in 1959, in part to lower printing costs with arguable success.
In the revision process, the heroine's original character was changed to be less unruly and violent.
In the 1980s, an older and more professional Nancy emerged in a new series, The Nancy Drew Files, that included romantic subplots for the sleuth.
The original Nancy Drew Mystery Stories series started in 1930 and ended in 2003.
Launched in 2004, the Girl Detective series features Nancy driving a hybrid electric vehicle and using a cell phone.
In 2012, the Girl Detective series ended, and a new series, Nancy Drew Diaries, was launched in 2013.
Illustrations of the character evolved over time to reflect contemporary styles.
The character proves continuously popular worldwide: at least 80million copies of the books have been sold, and the books have been translated into over 45 languages.
Nancy Drew is featured in five films, three television shows, and a number of popular computer games; she also appears in a variety of merchandise sold around the world.

Assessment: A person's financial situation is assessed by compiling simplified versions of financial statements including balance sheets and income statements.
A personal balance sheet lists the values of personal assets (e.g., car, house, clothes, stocks, bank account), along with personal liabilities (e.g., credit card debt, bank loan, mortgage).
A personal income statement lists personal income and expenses.
Goal setting: Having multiple goals is common, including a mix of short - and long - term goals.

Plan creation: The financial plan details how to accomplish the goals.
It could include, for example, reducing unnecessary expenses, increasing the employment income, or investing in the stock market.

Many people obtain assistance from professionals such as accountants, financial planners, investment advisers, and lawyers.
Monitoring and reassessment: As time passes, the financial plan is monitored for possible adjustments or reassessments.

Brugada syndrome is a genetic disease that result in mutations in the sodium ion channel (gene SCN5A) of the myocytes in the heart.
Brugada syndrome can result in ventricular fibrillation and potentially death.
It is a major cause of sudden unexpected cardiac death in young, otherwise healthy people.
While the characteristic patterns of Brugada syndrome on an electrocardiogram may be seen regularly, often the abnormal pattern is only seen spontaneously due to unknown triggers or after challenged by particular drugs.
Ajmaline is used intravenously to test for Brugada syndrome since they both affect the sodium ion channel.
In an afflicted person who was induced with ajmaline, the electrocardiogram would show the characteristic pattern of the syndrome where the ST segment is abnormally elevated above the baseline.
Due to complications that could arise with the ajmaline challenge, a specialized nurse should perform the administration and have an emergency defibrillator nearby.

This term is usually used to contrast with a transitory business or an Internet - only presence, such as fully online shops, which have no physical presence for shoppers to visit, talk with staff in person, touch and handle products and buy from the firm in person.
However, such online businesses normally have non-public physical facilities from which they either run business operations (e.g., the company headquarters and back office facilities), and / or warehouses for storing and distributing products. Concerns such as foot traffic, shopfront visibility, and appealing interior design apply to brick - and - mortar businesses rather than online ones.
An online - only business needs to have an attractive, well - designed website, a reliable e-commerce system for payment, a good delivery or shipping service and effective online marketing tactics to drive web traffic to the site.
Governments are also adopting e-government approaches, which is the use of online services for citizens to enable them to fill in government forms, pay tax bills and register for government programs online; these services aim to cut bricks and mortar costs (building leasing / purchase and staff costs) and improve services to citizens (by offering 24/7 access to information and services).

In 2010, Simon & Schuster then cut back from six Nancy Drew books per year, to four books per year.
In December 2011, they finally announced that the series was cancelled along with the Hardy Boys Undercover Brothers series.

In a notable case, Nintendo sought enforcement action against a hacker that for several years had gotten into Nintendo's internal database by various means including phishing to obtain plans of what games and hardware they had planned to announce for upcoming shows like E3, leaking this information to the Internet, impacting how Nintendo's own announcements were received.
Though the person was a minor when Nintendo brought the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to investigate, and had been warned by the FBI to desist, the person continued over 2018 and 2019 as an adult, taunting their actions over social media.
They were arrested in July 2019, and in addition to documents confirming the hacks, the FBI found a number of unauthorized game files as well as child pornography on their computers, leading to their admission of guilt for all crimes in January 2020.

In order to compete on systems sales Novell Data Systems planned a program to link more than one microcomputer to operate together.
The former ERI employees Drew Major, Dale Neibaur and Kyle Powell, known as the SuperSet Software group, were hired to this task.
The first Novell product was a proprietary hardware server based on the Motorola 68000 CPU supporting six MUX ports per board for a maximum of four boards per server using a star topology with twisted pair cabling.
A network interface card (NIC) was developed for the IBM PC industry standard architecture (ISA) bus.

Amorolfine (or amorolfin), is a morpholine antifungal drug that inhibits Δ14 - sterol reductase and cholestenol Δ - isomerase, which depletes ergosterol and causes ignosterol to accumulate in the fungal cytoplasmic cell membranes.
Marketed as Curanail, Loceryl, Locetar, and Odenil, amorolfine is commonly available in the form of a nail lacquer, containing 5% amorolfine hydrochloride as the active ingredient.
It is used to treat onychomycosis (fungal infection of the toe - and fingernails).
Amorolfine 5% nail lacquer in once - weekly or twice - weekly applications has been shown in two studies to be between 60% and 71% effective in treating toenail onychomycosis; complete cure rates three months after stopping treatment (after six months of treatment) were 38% and 46%.
However, full experimental details of these trials were not available and since they were first reported in 1992 there have been no subsequent trials.

According to a survey done by Harris Interactive, 99% of the adults agreed that personal finance should be taught in schools.
Financial authorities and the American federal government had offered free educational materials online to the public.
However, according to a Bank of America poll, 42% of adults were discouraged while 28% of adults thought that personal finance is a difficult subject because of vast amount of information available online.
As of 2015, 17 out of 50 states in the United States requires high school students to study personal finance before graduation.
The effectiveness of financial education on general audience is controversial.

Financially educated high school students are more likely to have a savings account with regular savings, fewer overdrafts and more likely to pay off their credit card balances.
However, another study was done by Cole and Shastry (Harvard Business School, 2009) found that there were no differences in saving behaviours of people in American states with financial literacy mandate enforced and the states without a literacy mandate.

In 1962, all Grosset & Dunlap books become "picture covers", books with artwork and advertising printed directly on their covers, as opposed to books with a dust jacket over a tweed volume. The change was to reduce production costs.
Several of the 1930s and 1940s cover illustrations were updated by Nappi for this change, depicting a Nancy of the Kennedy era, though the stories themselves were not updated.
Internal illustrations, which were dropped in 1937, were returned to the books beginning in 1954, as pen and ink line drawings, mostly by uncredited artists, but usually corresponding with Nappi's style of drawing Nancy on the covers.
Nappi followed trends initiated by Gillies and often illustrated Nancy wearing the same clothing more than once, including a mustard shirtwaist dress.
The year 2001 marked the introduction of two new Nintendo consoles: the Game Boy Advance, which was designed by Gwénaël Nicolas and stylistically departed from its predecessors, and the GameCube.
During the first week of the Game Boy Advance's North American release in June 2001, over 500,000 units were sold, making it the fastest - selling video game console in the United States at the time.
By the end of its production cycle in 2010, more than 81.5 million units had been sold worldwide.
As for the GameCube, despite such distinguishing features as the miniDVD format of its games and internet connectivity for a limited number of games, its sales were lower than those of its predecessors, and during the six years of its production, 21.7 million units were sold worldwide.
An innovative product developed by Nintendo during this time was the Nintendo e-Reader, a Game Boy Advance peripheral that allows the transfer of data stored on a series of cards to the console.
In 1993, she adopted two Russian boys, Misha and Dima.

In 2003, publishers Simon & Schuster ended the original Nancy Drew series and began featuring Nancy's character in a new mystery series, Girl Detective.
The Nancy Drew of the Girl Detective series drives a hybrid car, uses a mobile phone, and recounts her mysteries in the first person.
Many applaud these changes, arguing that Nancy has not really changed at all other than learning to use a cell phone.
Others praise the series as more realistic; Nancy, these commentators argue, is now a less - perfect and therefore more likable being, one whom girls can more easily relate to - a better role model than the old Nancy because she can actually be emulated, rather than a "prissy automaton of perfection."
This series is regarded as the most faithful series to the books; Martin is often regarded by many Nancy Drew fans as the best actress to portray her.
The series was also faithful in its tone of smaller mysteries, such as haunted houses or theft.
As Novell faced new competition, Noorda was replaced by Robert Frankenberg in April 1994.

A diatreme, sometimes known as a maar-diatreme volcano, is a volcanic pipe formed by a gaseous explosion.
When magma rises up through a crack in the Earth's crust and makes contact with a shallow body of ground water, rapid expansion of heated water vapor and volcanic gases can cause a series of explosions.
A relatively shallow crater is left (known as a maar) and a rock - filled fracture (the actual diatreme) in the Earth's crust.
Diatremes breach the Earth's surface and produce a steep inverted cone shape.

One thing to consider with personal finance and net worth goals is depreciating assets.
A depreciating asset is an asset that loses value over time or with use.
A few examples would be the vehicle that a person owns, boats, and capitalized expenses.
They add value to a person's life but unlike other assets they do not make money and should be a class of their own.
In the business world, for tax and bookkeeping purposes, these are depreciated over time due to the fact that their useful life runs out.
This is known as accumulated depreciation and the asset will eventually need to be replaced.
Licensees were not permitted to release the same game for a competing console until two years had passed.
Nintendo would decide how many cartridges would be supplied to the licensee.
Nintendo would decide how much space would be dedicated such as for articles and advertising in the Nintendo Power magazine.

Products may be out stock in relatively small brick and mortar retail stores and due to limited space in small business retail stores, these establishments may only be able to carry a few types of each product.
Online shops are able to have a huge amount of stock in numerous large warehouses (e.g., Amazon.com has warehouses in numerous locations from which it ships its products) which it can quickly ship out.
An online store may be able to order up products from a large number of geographically dispersed warehouses, even warehouses owned and operated by third parties (e.g., smaller companies), which are connected to the large company via the Internet.
Palermo's campaign in the 2017 - 18 Serie B aimed to an immediate promotion to the top flight, with Bruno Tedino as head coach and Fabio Lupo as director of football.
The Rosanero ended the first half of the season in first place; however, a streak of negative results and disagreements between Lupo and Zamparini led to the former's dismissal and replacement with Aladino Valoti.
As results did not improve, Tedino was ultimately dismissed as well and replaced by Roberto Stellone, who however failed on winning promotion, ending the regular season in fourth place and eventually losing the playoff finals to Frosinone.
The club also experienced a number of administrative issues which led to Zamparini appointing Giovanni Giammarva, an administrative expert from Palermo, as new president.
The early 1970s represented a watershed moment in Nintendo's history as it released Japan's first electronic toy - the Nintendo Beam Gun, an optoelectronic pistol designed by Masayuki Uemura.

Unlike Tandy, Nappi did not read the books before illustrating them; instead, his wife read them and provided him with a brief plot summary before Nappi began painting.
Nappi's first cover was for The Clue of the Velvet Mask, where he began a trend of portraying Nancy as "bobby - soxer... a contemporary sixteen - year - old.
This Nancy was perky, clean - cut, and extremely animated.
In the majority of his covers Nancy looks startled - which, no doubt, she was. "Nancy's style is considerably conservative, and remains so during the psychedelic period.
Although she wears bold colors and prints, or the background colors are shades of electric yellow, shocking pink, turquoise, or apple green, her clothing is high - necked and with long hemlines.
Earlier Nappi covers show Nancy in poses similar to those in the covers by Tandy and Gillies; for many updated covers he simply updated the color scheme, clothing style, and hairstyles of the characters but retains their original poses in similar settings.
Later Nappi covers show only Nancy's head or part of her body, surrounded by spooky or startling elements or clues from the story.
These Nappi covers would later be used for the opening credits of the television production, with photos of Pamela Sue Martin inserted on the book covers.

Yamauchi's experience with the previous initiatives led him to increase Nintendo's investment in a research and development department directed by Hiroshi Imanishi, an employee with a long history in other areas of the company.
In 1969, Gunpei Yokoi joined the department and was responsible for coordinating various projects.
Yokoi's experience in manufacturing electronic devices led Yamauchi to put him in charge of the company's games department, and his products would be mass - produced.
During this period, Nintendo built a new production plant in Uji City, just outside of Kyoto, and distributed classic tabletop games such as chess, shogi, go, and mahjong, as well as other foreign games under the Nippon Game brand.
The company's restructuring preserved a couple of areas dedicated to hanafuda card manufacturing.
Resident Evil 2 was developed by a group of about 45 people that later became part of Capcom Production Studio 4.
Director Hideki Kamiya led the team, which was composed of newer Capcom employees and over half of the staff from the original Resident Evil.
In the initial stages of development, producer Mikami often had creative disagreements with Kamiya, and tried to influence the team with his own direction.
He eventually stepped back to an overseeing role as producer, and only demanded to be shown the current build once a month.
Believing the game's assets to be good individually, but not yet satisfactory as a whole, Mikami expected that everything would coalesce in the three months leading up to the projected May 1997 release date.
Shortly thereafter, however, Resident Evil 1.5 was scrapped at a development stage of 60 - 80 percent.
Mikami later explained that the game would not have reached the desired quality in the aforementioned period, and especially frowned upon the gameplay and locations for being "dull and boring".

According to data from the company itself, Nintendo's first western - style deck was put on the market in 1902, although other documents postpone the date to 1907, shortly after the Russo - Japanese War.
The war created considerable difficulties for companies in the leisure sector, which were subject to new levies such as the Karuta Zei ('playing cards tax').
Despite this, Nintendo subsisted and, in 1907, entered into an agreement with Nihon Senbai - later known as the Japan Tobacco - to market its cards to various cigarette stores throughout the country.
A promotional calendar distributed by Nintendo from the Taishō era dated to 1915 was found, indicating that the company was named Yamauchi Nintendo and used the Marufuku Nintendo Co. brand for its playing cards.

The club had to wait for the new jerseys for three months, because no pink flannel material was available in Palermo and the appointed tailoring company had to import it from England.
The new shirts were first worn in a match against Sir Thomas Lipton's crew team; the match ended in a 2 - 1 win for Palermo.
From 1936 to 1940, the team were forced to play in red and yellow jerseys due to an imposition by the fascist regime of Benito Mussolini (red and yellow being the official colours of the municipality of Palermo.) When the club was refounded in 1941 following a merger with Juventina Palermo, they started dressing in light blue shirts on the pitch, but switched back to the very popular pink and black only one year later.

Founded in current research on the adverse consequences of overusing technology, "mobile phone overuse" has been proposed as a subset of forms of "digital addiction", or "digital dependence", reflecting increasing trends of compulsive behaviour amongst users of technological devices.
Researchers have variously termed these behaviours "smartphone addiction", "problematic smartphone use", as well as referring to mobile phones (cell phones) rather than solely smartphones.
Forms of technology addiction have been considered as diagnoses since the mid 1990s.
Panova and Carbonell published a review in 2018 that specifically encouraged terminology of "problematic use" in regard to technology behaviours, rather than continuing research based on other behavioral addictions.

Due to his successful results, Palermo confirmed Iachini as head coach for the 2014 - 15 Serie A season, and agreed a contract extension until June 2016 with him.
A new director of football, Franco Ceravolo (formerly a scout for Juventus), was instead named in place of Perinetti, but was removed (with Iachini being instead confirmed) after a dismal season start led Zamparini to intervene in order to turn the team's fortunes.
The non-playing staff changes at Palermo turned out to be ultimately successful, with Palermo winning many games afterwards and entering the fight for a UEFA Europa League spot thanks to the all - Argentine striking force of Paulo Dybala and Franco Vázquez.

Alternatively, pups can be infected vertically through endogenous infection, inheriting the virus directly from their mother in the germline.
Mice that become infected in this way have higher rates of occurrence of tumors.
A retrovirus is endogenous to its host once the proviral DNA is inserted into the chromosomal DNA.
As a result, mice with endogenous MMTV have the virus's DNA in every cell of its body, as the virus is present in the DNA of the sperm or egg cell from which the animal is conceived.

This was due to the authors' lack of research on cars at the time of writing the book, and the 1934 model was more the look the authors had in mind.
The various creature visual effects, including the hellhound, Satan, and Usher, was handled by Milk VFX.

The character of Nancy Drew has gone through many permutations over the years.
The Nancy Drew Mystery series was revised beginning in 1959; with commentators agreeing that Nancy's character changed significantly from the original Nancy of the books written in the 1930s and 1940s.
Nevertheless, some find no significant difference among the permutations of Nancy Drew, finding Nancy to be simply a good role model for girls.
Despite revisions, "What has n't changed, however, are basic values, her goals, her humility, and her magical gift for having at least nine lives.
For more than six decades, her essence has remained intact.
"Nancy is a" teen detective queen "who" offers girl readers something more than action - packed adventure: she gives them something original.
Convention has it that girls are passive, respectful, and emotional, but with the energy of a girl shot out of a cannon, Nancy bends conventions and acts out every girl's fantasies of power.
Nelvana began production of another Nancy Drew television show in 1995.
Tracy Ryan starred as Nancy Drew, with Jhene Erwin as Bess Marvin, Joy Tanner as George Fayne, and, in a recurring role, Scott Speedman as Ned Nickerson.

The clearer sound effects of the Dreamcast port were received well by Game Revolution's Shawn Sparks, who also remarked that the character models look slightly sharper.
However, Steve Key of Computer And Video Games disliked the Dreamcast release's low - resolution backgrounds, which he thought made the characters stand out too much from the environments, and thus lessened the game's atmosphere.
GameSpot staff writer James Mielke did not believe that the Dreamcast port was "an essential purchase", but still called it a "great game" at an attractively low price.
The GameCube release was heavily criticized for its high price and dated graphics.
However, "Four - Eyed Dragon" of GamePro noted its superior in - game visuals of any version of the game.
Davis and 1UP.com's Mark MacDonald were disappointed by the port's lack of features that were included in the Nintendo 64 release.
Peer Schneider of IGN found the 2.5 D version for the Game.com to be frustrating and only "partially faithful" to the original release of Resident Evil 2.
Although he believed that its graphics and sound effects managed to recreate the original game's atmosphere to a certain extent, he thought that its controls were too "sluggish" to allow for an enjoyable experience.

In 2004, the last remnants of Nintendo's original headquarters was reportedly demolished.
Later that year, Nintendo released the Nintendo DS, which featured such innovations as dual screens - one of which being a touchscreen - and wireless connectivity for multiplayer play.
Throughout its lifetime, more than 154 million units were sold, making it the most successful handheld console and the second best - selling console in history.
In 2005, Nintendo released the Game Boy Micro, the last system in the Game Boy line.
Sales did not meet Nintendo's expectations, with 2.5 million units being sold by 2007.
In mid-2005, the Nintendo World Store was inaugurated in New York City.

Saraiki was considered a dialect of Punjabi by most British colonial administrators, and is still seen as such by many Punjabis.
Saraikis, however, consider it a language in its own right and see the use of the term "dialect" as stigmatising.
A language movement was started in the 1960s to standardise a script and promote the language.
Shahrel joined Malaysia FAM League club PKNP FC in 2016 from Perak U-21 team.
He made his league debut in 0 - 0 draw in away match against KDMM coming from bench on 28 February 2016.
His first and second goals for PKNP FC came from 0 - 5 win over PBMM on 9 March 2017.
Shahrel made 20 appearances and 13 goals in his debut season with PKNP FC.
Adams filed a countersuit, claiming the case was in poor taste and frivolous, and that, as author of the Nancy Drew series, she retained the rights to her work.
Although Adams had written many of the titles after 1953, and edited others, she claimed to be the author of all of the early titles.
In fact, she had rewritten the older titles and was not their original author.
When Mildred Benson was called to testify about her work for the Syndicate, Benson's role in writing the manuscripts of early titles was revealed in court with extensive documentation, contradicting Adams' claims to authorship.
The court ruled that Grosset had the rights to publish the original series as they were in print in 1980, but did not own characters or trademarks.
Furthermore, any new publishers chosen by Adams were completely within their rights to print new titles.
After the end of the 2017 domestic season, Shahrel rumoured to be on his way out of the club, in a surprising turn of events, the club has just announced that Shahrel have instead extended his contract with the team until 2020.
A whole host of clubs have been linked with the signature of Shahrel including Perak, Terengganu and Johor Darul Ta 'zim.

A known side effect of this policy is the Genesis version of Mortal Kombat having more than double the unit sales of the Super NES version, mainly because Nintendo had forced publisher Acclaim to recolor the red blood to look like white sweat and replace some of the more gory graphics in its release of the game, making it less violent.
By contrast, Sega allowed blood and gore to remain in the Genesis version (though a code is required to unlock the gore).
Nintendo allowed the Super NES version of Mortal Kombat II to ship uncensored the following year with a content warning on the packaging.
Queues (lineups and waiting rooms) are part and parcel of B&M retail businesses, due to physical constraints and the limitations on how many staff the business can afford to hire.
A physical store may only have a few salespeople to serve customers, so many customers may have to wait in line during the busiest hours.
To lessen the stress of waiting, some B&M stores provide big - screen TVs with cable TV, free coffee and newspapers; while these niceties improve the customer experience, they add to the costs of operating a B&M establishment.
On the other hand, an online virtual store in which customers select their own purchases in a virtual "shopping cart" and pay for them using e-commerce approaches may be able to serve thousands of customers at the same time.
B&M increases the fixed cost for any business, therefore the products sold in physical shops tend to be more expensive compared to online shops.
For stores selling expensive products or services in a B&M format, customers expect beautiful window displays, fine decorating in the establishment and well - dressed salespeople who earn high commission on their sales.
Some high - end hair salons and luxury car stores even offer conveniences such as free espresso and bottled water, all of which add to the overhead of selling these products and services.
Online shops, even those for luxury goods, do not have to pay for high - end retail stores and salespeople. Nevertheless, high - end online stores typically incur higher costs for their online presence, because they need to have leading edge Web 2.0 functions on their website, a professionally designed site, and in some cases, staff available to respond to phone calls, e-mails and online "chat" questions.
Eccrine sweat glands are distributed almost all over the human body, in varying densities, with the highest density in palms and soles, then on the head, but much less on the trunk and the extremities.
Its water - based secretion represents a primary form of cooling in humans.
Apocrine sweat glands are mostly limited to the axillae (armpits) and perianal area in humans.
They are not significant for cooling in humans, but are the sole effective sweat glands in hoofed animals, such as the camels, donkeys, horses, and cattle.

Critics saw this Nancy of the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s as an improvement in some ways, a step back in others: "In these new editions, an array of elements had been modified... and most of the more overt elements of racism had been excised.
In an often overlooked alteration, however, the tomboyishness of the text's title character was also tamed.
The definition of the damping ratio and natural frequency presumes that the overall feedback system is well approximated by a second order system; i.e. the system has a dominant pair of poles.
This is often not the case, so it is good practice to simulate the final design to check if the project goals are satisfied.
Since then, Nintendo has produced some of the most successful consoles in the video game industry, such as the Game Boy, the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, the Wii, and the Nintendo Switch.
Nintendo has also released numerous influential franchises, including Donkey Kong, Mario, The Legend of Zelda, Kirby, Metroid, Fire Emblem, Splatoon, Super Smash Bros., and Pokémon.
Often, "Nancy's face wears the blank expression of one lost in thought," making her appear passive.
On the cover of The Strange Message in the Parchment (1977), for example, in contrast to earlier covers, Nancy is not shown in the midst of danger or even watching a mystery unfold from a distance.
Instead, Nancy is shown thinking about the clues; in general, Nancy becomes less confident and more puzzled.

In 2015 - 16 season, Palermo started their season without Dybala after the youngster moved to Juventus; the Rosanero therefore relied on senior striker Alberto Gilardino to play as a partner of Vázquez.
On 10 November 2015, coach Giuseppe Iachini was sacked due to disappointing results and replaced by Davide Ballardini.
Ballardini only lasted for 7 matches with Palermo before fired by Zamparini after spectacularly falling out with Palermo's players.
Palermo captain Stefano Sorrentino reported that during 1 - 0 victory against Hellas Verona, the coach did not speak to Palermo players neither before nor after the match.
Rosanero then hired Guillermo Barros Schelotto as a new manager, even though he did not have the necessary paperwork to be registered as Palermo coach, so his position was taken by Primavera youth team coach Giovanni Bosi during a 4 - 1 win over Udinese. Schelotto was registered as a team manager during that match.
Bosi's place as "official" manager was then taken over by Giovanni Tedesco, with Schelotto still awaiting for his paperwork.
On 10 February 2016, following Schelotto's resignation after UEFA refusal to hand him a valid European coaching authorization, Palermo announced to have promoted Primavera youth coach Giovanni Bosi as new head coach, with Tedesco as his technical collaborator.
Five days later, Bosi was sacked, and Iachini was re-appointed as manager.
On 10 March, Iachini was sacked once again, as Walter Novellino was appointed as his replacement.
Davide Ballardini was rehired a day later for the ninth managerial change that season.
On 15 May, Palermo escaped relegation on the last day of the league with the necessary win over Hellas Verona 3 - 2, securing 16th place.
World War II negatively impacted the company as Japanese authorities prohibited the diffusion of foreign card games, and as the priorities of Japanese society shifted, its interest in recreational activities waned.
During this time, Nintendo was partly supported by a financial injection from Hiroshi's wife Michiko Inaba, who came from a wealthy family.

By the 2nd century BC, Roman historians were using the saeculum to periodize their chronicles and track wars.
At the time of the reign of emperor Augustus, the Romans decided that a saeculum was 110 years.
In 17 BC, Caesar Augustus organised Ludi saeculares ("saecular games") for the first time to celebrate the "fifth saeculum of Rome".
Later emperors like Claudius and Septimius Severus have celebrated the passing of saecula with games at irregular intervals.
In 248, Philip the Arab combined Ludi saeculares with the 1000th anniversary of the founding of Rome.
The new millennium that Rome entered was called the saeculum novum, a term that got a metaphysical connotation in Christianity, referring to the worldly age (hence "secular").
In a 2009 interview with the Discovery Channel, Mike Brown noted that, while it is not impossible that the Sun has a distant planetary companion, such an object would have to be lying very far from the observed regions of the Solar System to have no detectable gravitational effect on the other planets.
A Mars - sized object could lie undetected at 300AU (10 times the distance of Neptune); a Jupiter - sized object at 30,000 AU.
To travel 1000AU in two years, an object would need to be moving at 2400km / s - faster than the galactic escape velocity.
At that speed, any object would be shot out of the Solar System, and then out of the Milky Way galaxy into intergalactic space.
With the increase of the cards' popularity, Yamauchi hired assistants to mass - produce in order to satisfy demand.
Despite a favorable start, however, the company faced financial difficulties due to the slow and expensive manufacturing process, high product price, coupled with operating in a niche market, as well as the long durability of the cards, which impacted sales due to the low replacement rate.
As a solution, Nintendo produced a cheaper and lower - quality line of playing cards, Tengu, while also seeking to offer his products in other cities such as Osaka, where considerable profits were found in card games.
In addition, local merchants were interested in the prospect of a continuous renewal of decks, thus avoiding the suspicions that reusing cards would generate.

The covers of The Nancy Drew Files and Girl Detective series represent further departures from the bold, confident character portrayed by Tandy.
The Nancy portrayed on the covers of The Nancy Drew Files is "a markedly sexy Nancy, with a handsome young man always lurking in the background.
Her clothes often reveal an ample bustline and her expression is mischievous.
In the Girl Detective series, Nancy's face is depicted on each cover in fragments.
Her eyes, for example, are confined to a strip across the top of the cover while her mouth is located near the spine in a box independent of her eyes.
The artwork for Nancy's eyes and mouth is taken from Rudy Nappi's cover art for the revised version of The Secret of the Old Clock.

Gascon is a dialect of Occitan, considered by some linguists to be a separate language.
In the 1990s, Palermo played between Serie B and Serie C1 with a few highs, such as its 1995 - 96 Serie B and Coppa Italia campaign, the latter ending in the quarter - finals, and a number of lows such as the 1998 relegation to Serie C2 after defeat in the play - offs to Battipagliese, later revoked by the federation to fill a vacant league slot.
Two key events in Nintendo's history occurred in 1979: its American subsidiary was opened in New York City, and a new department focused on arcade game development was created.
In 1980, the first handheld video game system, the Game & Watch, was created by Yokoi from the technology used in portable calculators.
It became one of Nintendo's most successful products, with over 43.4 million units sold worldwide during its production period, and for which 59 games were made in total.
Initially a racetrack was present, and there were no curved sections, but only terraces and a stand.
In 1948, following the end of World War II and the fall of the Fascist regime, the stadium assumed the denomination of Stadio La Favorita, after the neighbourhood where it was located, and was also heavily restructured, without racetrack and with two curved sections, thus increasing its capacity to 30,000.
In 1984 it was again enlarged, giving a capacity of circa 50,000.
This higher capacity was however completely sold out only twice, respectively in a Serie C1 league match against Messina and a friendly match against Juventus.
On the occasion of the 1990 FIFA World Cup, the stadium was renovated with the addition of seats, but the capacity, which was reached on only two occasions before 1990, was reduced to 37,619.
During the 1989 renovation works, five employees died following the collapse of a section of the stadium.
In 2002 the stadium was renamed in honour of Renzo Barbera, legendary Palermo chairman in the 1970s.
Setting aside its provision for a balanced budget amendment, the Jobs Through Growth Act would likely have a negligible effect on jobs or GDP in the near term. However, if the balanced budget amendment were passed into law, it would result in a drastic reduction in government spending that would exacerbate the output gap.
The character was conceived by Edward Stratemeyer, founder of the Stratemeyer Syndicate.
In 1926 Stratemeyer created the Hardy Boys series (although the first volumes were not published until 1927), which was such a success that he decided on a similar series for girls, featuring an amateur girl detective as the heroine.
While Stratemeyer believed that a woman's place was in the home, he was aware that the Hardy Boys books were popular with girl readers and wished to capitalize on girls' interest in mysteries by offering a strong female heroine.
In March, 2017 Dynamite Entertainment released Anthony Del Col's reboot of classic characters Nancy Drew and The Hardy Boys with Nancy Drew & The Hardy Boys: The Big Lie.
Del Col has been a lifelong fan of the characters and was successful in working with Simon & Schuster to secure the comic book rights and then pitch to publishers.
In September 2014, a sustained release formulation of the drug was approved for marketing in the United States under the brand name Contrave.

It was approved in Canada under the Contrave brand name in 2018.
As the concerns about consumers' financial capability have increased in recent years, a variety of education programmes has emerged, catering to a broad audience or to a specific group of people such as youth and women.
The educational programmes are frequently known as "financial literacy".
However, there was no standardised curriculum for personal finance education until after the 2008 financial crisis.
The United States President's Advisory Council on Financial Capability was set up in 2008 in order to encourage financial literacy among the American people.
It also stressed the importance of developing a standard in the field of financial education.

After its initial release for the PlayStation in January 1998, Resident Evil 2 was reissued and ported to other systems, often gaining new features in the process.
The first re-release was the Dual Shock Ver., which incorporated support for the vibration and analog control functions of the PlayStation's DualShock controller.
Other additions include a new unlockable minigame called "Extreme Battle", and a "Rookie" mode that enables the player to start the main story with a powerful weapon that features infinite ammunition.
The Japanese release of the Dual Shock Ver. contained a "U.S.A. Version" mode based on the difficulty level of Resident Evil 2's Western versions.
served as the basis for the majority of ports, such as the Windows 9x - based PC - CD version Resident Evil 2 Platinum.
Aside from retaining all previously added features, the PC version can be run in higher resolutions.
A "Data Gallery" was added to the main menu, allowing the player to view movies, rough sketches, illustrations and 3D models.
In February 2006, a Japan - exclusive, Windows XP - compatible PC - DVD re-release was published.
Developed by Sourcenext, it included high - quality FMVs encoded at a resolution of 640 × 480 pixels.
The Dreamcast version keeps the additions from the original PC release, and incorporates real - time display of the character's condition on the Visual Memory Unit peripheral.
The Japanese edition of the Dreamcast port was given the subtitle Value Plus and came with a playable demo of Resident Evil - Code: Veronica.
An unmodified port of the Dual Shock Ver. was released for the GameCube.
The initial PlayStation version was re-released on the Japanese PlayStation Network in 2007, while the service's North American counterpart received the Dual Shock Ver. two years later.

For the 2012 - 13 season, Zamparini came with another staff revolution, appointing Giorgio Perinetti as the new director of football and Giuseppe Sannino as the manager, both coming from Siena.
Significant sales included Federico Balzaretti and Giulio Migliaccio, who left the Rosanero as part of a complete restructuring.
The season started in unfashionable manner, leading to Gian Piero Gasperini and Pietro Lo Monaco replacing Sannino and Perinetti.
As Palermo descended into the relegation zone, Alberto Malesani replaced Gasperini for three games, Perinetti returned in place for Lo Monaco, and ultimately Sannino was re-hired to replace Gasperini.
Despite a slight increase in results, Palermo ended its season in 18th place, being thus relegated to Serie B after nine consecutive seasons in the top flight.

In 1933, Sekiryo Kaneda established the company as a general partnership titled Yamauchi Nintendo & Co. Ltd., investing in the construction of a new corporate headquarters located next to the original building, near the Toba - kaidō train station.
Because Sekiryo's marriage to Yamauchi's daughter produced no male heirs, he planned to adopt his son - in - law Shikanojo Inaba, an artist in the company's employ and the father of his grandson Hiroshi, born in 1927.
However, Inaba abandoned his family and the company, so Hiroshi was made Sekiryo's eventual successor.

Video game ratings systems were introduced with the Entertainment Software Rating Board of 1994 and the Pan European Game Information of 2003, and Nintendo discontinued most of its censorship policies in favor of consumers making their own choices.
Today, changes to the content of games are done primarily by the game's developer or, occasionally, at the request of Nintendo.
The only clear - set rule is that ESRB AO - rated games will not be licensed on Nintendo consoles in North America, a practice which is also enforced by Sony and Microsoft, its two greatest competitors in the present market.
Nintendo has since allowed several mature - content games to be published on its consoles, including these: Perfect Dark, Conker's Bad Fur Day, Doom, Doom 64, BMX XXX, the Resident Evil series, Killer7, the Mortal Kombat series, Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem, BloodRayne, Geist, Dementium: The Ward, Bayonetta 2, Devil's Third, and Fatal Frame: Maiden of Black Water.
Certain games have continued to be modified, however.
For example, Konami was forced to remove all references to cigarettes in the 2000 Game Boy Color game Metal Gear Solid (although the previous NES version of Metal Gear and the subsequent GameCube game Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes both included such references, as did Wii game MadWorld), and maiming and blood were removed from the Nintendo 64 port of Cruis'n USA.
Another example is in the Game Boy Advance game Mega Man Zero 3, in which one of the bosses, called Hellbat Schilt in the Japanese and European releases, was renamed Devilbat Schilt in the North American localization.
In North America releases of the Mega Man Zero games, enemies and bosses killed with a saber attack do not gush blood as they do in the Japanese versions.
However, the release of the Wii was accompanied by a number of even more controversial games, such as Manhunt 2, No More Heroes, The House of the Dead: Overkill, and MadWorld, the latter three of which were published exclusively for the console.
Japanese culture stipulated that for Nintendo Koppai to continue as a family business after Yamauchi's retirement, Yamauchi had to adopt his son - in - law so that he may take over the business.
As result, Sekiryo Kaneda adopted the Yamauchi surname in 1907 and became the second president of Nintendo Koppai in 1929.
By that time, Nintendo Koppai was the largest card game company in Japan.

In mid-1993, Nintendo and Silicon Graphics announced a strategic alliance to develop the Nintendo 64.
The Nintendo 64 was marketed as one of the first consoles to be designed with 64 - bit architecture.
As part of an agreement with Midway Games, the arcade games Killer Instinct and Cruis'n USA were ported to the console.
Although the Nintendo 64 was planned for release in 1995, the production schedules of third - party developers influenced a delay, and the console was released in June and September 1996 in Japan and the United States respectively, and in March 1997 in Europe.
By the end of its production in 2002, around 33 million Nintendo 64 consoles were sold worldwide, and it is considered one of the most recognized video game systems in history.
388 games were produced for the Nintendo 64 in total, some of which - particularly Super Mario 64, The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time and GoldenEye 007 - have been distinguished as some of the greatest of all time.

Schmidt cameras have very strongly curved focal planes, thus requiring that the film, plate, or other detector be correspondingly curved.
In some cases the detector is made curved; in others flat media is mechanically conformed to the shape of the focal plane through the use of retaining clips or bolts, or by the application of a vacuum.
A field flattener, in its simplest form a planoconvex lens in front of the film plate or detector, is sometimes used.
Since the corrector plate is at the center of curvature of the primary mirror in this design the tube length can be very long for a wide - field telescope.
There are also the drawbacks of having the obstruction of the film holder or detector mounted at the focus halfway up the tube assembly, a small amount of light is blocked and there is a loss in contrast in the image due to diffraction effects of the obstruction and its support structure.

In 1974, Nintendo released Wild Gunman, a skeet shooting simulator consisting of a 16 mm image projector with a sensor that detects a beam from the player's light gun.
Both the Laser Clay Shooting System and Wild Gunman were successfully exported to Europe and North America.
Despite this, Nintendo's production speeds were still slow compared to rival companies such as Bandai and Tomy, and their prices were high, which led to the discontinuation of some of their light gun products.

The usual way of finding the LFC is to lift a parcel from a lower level along the dry adiabatic lapse rate until it crosses the mixing ratio line of the parcel: this is the lifted condensation level (LCL).
From there on, follow the moist adiabatic lapse rate until the temperature of the parcel reaches the air mass temperature, at the equilibrium level (EL).
If the temperature of the parcel along the moist adiabat is warmer than the environment on further lift, one has found the LFC.
In fact, there is no unified Béarnais dialect, as the language differs considerably throughout the province.
Many of the differences in pronunciation can be divided into east, west, and south (the mountainous regions).
For example, an 'a' at the end of words is pronounced "ah" in the west, "o" in the east, and "œ" in the south.
Because of Béarn's specific political past, Béarnais has been distinguished from Gascon since the 16th century, not for linguistic reasons.

A cultural icon, Nancy Drew is cited as a formative influence by a number of women, from Supreme Court Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and Sonia Sotomayor to former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and former First Lady Laura Bush.
Feminist literary critics have analyzed the character's enduring appeal, arguing variously that Nancy Drew is a mythic hero, an expression of wish fulfillment, or an embodiment of contradictory ideas about femininity.
Tandy often portrays Nancy Drew with confident, assertive body language.
She never appears "shocked, trepidatious, or scared".
Nancy is shown either boldly in the center of the action or actively, but secretively, investigating a clue.
She is often observed by a menacing figure and appears to be in imminent danger, but her confident expression suggests to viewers that she is in control of the situation.
Igneous intrusions cause the formation of a diatreme only in the specific setting where groundwater exists.

Problematic smartphone use also known as smartphone overuse, smartphone addiction, mobile phone overuse, or cell phone dependency, is proposed by some researchers to be a form of psychological or behavioral dependence on cell phones, closely related to other forms of digital media overuse such as social media addiction or internet addiction disorder.
Other researchers have stated that terminology relating to behavioral addictions in regards to smartphone use can cause additional problems both in research and stigmatisation of users, suggesting the term to evolve to problematic smartphone use.
Problematic use can include preoccupation with mobile communication, excessive money or time spent on mobile phones, use of mobile phones in socially or physically inappropriate situations such as driving an automobile.
Increased use can also lead to increased time on mobile communication, adverse effects on relationships, and anxiety if separated from a mobile phone or sufficient signal.
The law of evidence, also known as the rules of evidence, encompasses the rules and legal principles that govern the proof of facts in a legal proceeding.
These rules determine what evidence must or must not be considered by the trier of fact in reaching its decision.
The trier of fact is a judge in bench trials, or the jury in any cases involving a jury.
The law of evidence is also concerned with the quantum (amount), quality, and type of proof needed to prevail in litigation.
The rules vary depending upon whether the venue is a criminal court, civil court, or family court, and they vary by jurisdiction.

A magnifying glass, which uses a positive (convex) lens to make things look bigger by allowing the user to hold them closer to their eye.
A telescope, which uses its large objective lens or primary mirror to create an image of a distant object and then allows the user to examine the image closely with a smaller eyepiece lens, thus making the object look larger.
A microscope, which makes a small object appear as a much larger image at a comfortable distance for viewing.
A microscope is similar in layout to a telescope except that the object being viewed is close to the objective, which is usually much smaller than the eyepiece.

Many prominent and successful women cite Nancy Drew as an early formative influence whose character encouraged them to take on unconventional roles, including U.S. Supreme Court Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Sonia Sotomayor; TV personalities Oprah Winfrey and Barbara Walters; singers Barbra Streisand and Beverly Sills; mystery authors Sara Paretsky and Nancy Pickard; scholar Carolyn Heilbrun; actresses Ellen Barkin and Emma Roberts; former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton; former First Lady Laura Bush; and former president of the National Organization for Women Karen DeCrow.
Less prominent women also credit the character of Nancy Drew with helping them to become stronger women; when the first Nancy Drew conference was held, at the University of Iowa, in 1993, conference organizers received a flood of calls from women who "all had stories to tell about how instrumental Nancy had been in their lives, and about how she had inspired, comforted, entertained them through their childhoods, and, for a surprising number of women, well into adulthood."
As his fame increased, Croce was persuaded, against his initial wishes, to become involved with politics.
In 1910, he was appointed to the Italian Senate, a lifelong position (Ryn, 2000: xi).
He was an open critic of Italy's participation in World War I, feeling that it was a suicidal trade war.
Although this made him initially unpopular, his reputation was restored after the war.
In 1919, he supported the government of Francesco Saverio Nitti while also expressing his admiration for the nascent Weimar Republic and the German Social Democrats.
He was Minister of Public Education between 1920 and 1921 for the 5th and last government headed by Giovanni Giolitti.
Benito Mussolini assumed power slightly more than a year after Croce's exit from the government; Mussolini's first Minister of Public Education was Giovanni Gentile, an independent who later became a fascist and with whom Croce had earlier cooperated in a philosophical polemic against positivism.
Gentile remained minister for only a year but managed to begin a comprehensive reform of Italian education that was based partly on Croce's earlier suggestions.
Gentile's reform remained in force well beyond the Fascist regime, and was only partly abolished in 1962.

Nestor also had two daughters named Pisidice and Polycaste.
The name is a metonym derived from the traditional building materials associated with physical buildings: bricks and mortar.
The term was originally used by 19th century British novelist Charles Dickens in the book Little Dorrit. The term brick - and - mortar businesses is also a retronym, in that most shops had a physical presence before the advent of the Internet.
The term is also applicable in a pre-Internet era, when contrasting businesses with physical retail presence with those that operated strictly in an order - by - mail capacity pre-Internet.
The image recorded by a photographic film or image sensor is always a real image and is usually inverted.
When measuring the height of an inverted image using the cartesian sign convention (where the x-axis is the optical axis) the value for hi will be negative, and as a result M will also be negative.
However, the traditional sign convention used in photography is "real is positive, virtual is negative".
Therefore, in photography: Object height and distance are always real and positive.
When the focal length is positive the image's height, distance and magnification are real and positive.
Only if the focal length is negative, the image's height, distance and magnification are virtual and negative.
Therefore, the photographic magnification formulae are traditionally presented as:

Generally, sweat glands consist of a secretory unit consisting of a base rolled into a glomerulum, and a duct that carries the sweat away.
The secretory coil or base, is set deep in the lower dermis and hypodermis, and the entire gland is surrounded by adipose tissue.
In both sweat gland types, the secretory coils are surrounded by contractile myoepithelial cells that function to facilitate excretion of secretory product.
The secretory activities of the gland cells and the contractions of myoepithelial cells are controlled by both the autonomic nervous system and by the circulating hormones.
The distal or apical part of the duct that opens to the skin's surface is known as the acrosyringium.
Amid financial threat, Nintendo of America relocated from Manhattan to the Seattle metro to remove major stressors: the frenetic New York and New Jersey lifestyle and commute, and the extra weeks or months on the shipping route from Japan as was suffered by the Radar Scope disaster.
With the Seattle harbor being the US's closest to Japan at only nine days by boat, and having a lumber production market for arcade cabinets, Arakawa's real estate scouts found a 60,000 - square - foot (5,600 m2) warehouse for rent containing three offices - one for Arakawa and one for Judy and Stone. This warehouse in the Tukwila suburb was owned by Mario Segale after whom the Mario character would be named, and was initially managed by former Far East Video employee Don James. After one month, James recruited his college friend Howard Phillips as assistant, who soon took over as warehouse manager.
The company remained at fewer than 10 employees for some time, handling sales, marketing, advertising, distribution, and limited manufacturing of arcade cabinets and Game & Watch handheld units, all sourced and shipped from Nintendo.

In 1995, Nancy Drew finally goes to college in the Nancy Drew on Campus series.
These books read more similar to soap opera books, such as the Sweet Valley High series.
The On Campus books focus more on romance plots, and also centered around other characters; the mysteries were merely used as subplots.

Ajmaline was first discovered to lengthen the refractory period of the heart by blocking sodium ion channels, but it has also been noted that it is also able to interfere with the hERG (human Ether-a-go-go-Related Gene) potassium ion channel.
In both cases, Ajmaline causes the action potential to become longer and ultimately leads to bradycardia.
When ajmaline reversibly blocks hERG, repolarization occurs more slowly because it is harder for potassium to get out due to less unblocked channels, therefore making the RS interval longer.
Ajmaline also prolongs the QR interval since it can also act as sodium channel blocker, therefore making it take longer for the membrane to depolarize in the first case.

IGN's Ricardo Sanchez thought that the game's atmosphere was "dead on", and claimed that "graphics, sound effects, music and level design all work together to create a spooky, horror - filled world".
Ryan Mac Donald of GameSpot shared the opinion, and found the game to be "like a product out of Hollywood".
He believed that it was "more an interactive, cinematic experience than a video game".
Writing for Computer and Video Games, Paul Mallinson considered the game's atmosphere, story and film - like presentation its most outstanding features.
Although he found its plot to be "far - fetched", he believed it was "kept down to earth by clever scripting and gritty storytelling".

At the insistence of publishers Grosset & Dunlap, the Nancy Drew books were revised beginning in 1959, both to make the books more modern and to eliminate racist stereotypes.
Although Harriet Adams felt that these changes were unnecessary, she oversaw a complete overhaul of the series, as well as writing new volumes in keeping with the new guidelines laid down by Grosset & Dunlap.
The series did not so much eliminate racial stereotypes, however, as eliminate non-white characters altogether.
For example, in the original version of The Hidden Window Mystery (1956), Nancy visits friends in the south whose African - American servant, "lovable old Beulah... serves squabs, sweet potatoes, corn pudding, piping hot biscuits, and strawberry shortcake." The mistress of the house waits until Beulah has left the room and then says to Nancy, "I try to make things easier for Beulah but she insists on cooking and serving everything the old - fashioned way."
I must confess, though, that I love it. In the revised 1975 version, Beulah is changed to Anna, a "plump, smiling housekeeper".

A dwarf star is a star of relatively small size and low luminosity.
Most main sequence stars are dwarf stars.
The term was originally coined in 1906 when the Danish astronomer Ejnar Hertzsprung noticed that the reddest stars - classified as K and M in the Harvard scheme could be divided into two distinct groups.
They are either much brighter than the Sun, or much fainter.
To distinguish these groups, he called them "giant" and "dwarf" stars, the dwarf stars being fainter and the giants being brighter than the Sun.
Most stars are currently classified under the Morgan Keenan System using the letters O, B, A, F, G, K, and M, a sequence from the hottest: O type, to the coolest: M type. The scope of the term "dwarf" was later expanded to include the following:

The Nancy Drew character of the Files series has earned mixed reviews among fans.
Some contend that Nancy's character becomes "more like Mildred Wirt Benson's original heroine than any since 1956."
Others criticize the series for its increasing incorporation of romance and "of pre-feminist moxie."
One reviewer noticed "Millie purists tend to look askance upon the Files series, in which fleeting pecks bestowed on Nancy by her longtime steady, Ned Nickerson, give way to lingering embraces in a Jacuzzi." Cover art for Files titles, such as Hit and Run Holiday (1986), reflects these changes; Nancy is often dressed provocatively, in short skirts, shirts that reveal her stomach or cleavage, or a bathing suit. She is often pictured with an attentive, handsome male in the background, and frequently appears aware of and interested in that male.
The books place more emphasis on violence and character relationships, with Nancy Drew and Ned Nickerson becoming a more on - off couple, and both having other love interests that can span multiple books.

Steam locomotives were first developed in Great Britain during the early 19th century and used for railway transport until the middle of the 20th century.
From the early 1900s they were gradually superseded by electric and diesel locomotives, with full conversions to electric and diesel power beginning from the 1930s.
The majority of steam locomotives were retired from regular service by the 1980s, though several continue to run on tourist and heritage lines.

In the early 1980s, several video game consoles proliferated in the United States, as well as low - quality games produced by third - party developers, which oversaturated the market and led to the video game crash of 1983.
Consequently, a recession hit the American video game industry, whose revenues went from over $3 billion to $100 million between 1983 and 1985.
Nintendo's initiative to launch the Famicom in America was also impacted.
To differentiate the Famicom from its competitors in America, Nintendo opted to redesign the Famicom as an "entertainment system" compatible with "Game Paks", a euphemism for cartridges, and with a design reminiscent of a VCR.
Nintendo implemented a lockout chip in the Game Paks that gave it control on what games were published for the console to avoid the market saturation that occurred in the United States' market.
The resulting product was the Nintendo Entertainment System, or NES, which was released in North America in 1985.
The landmark titles Super Mario Bros. and The Legend of Zelda were produced for the console by Miyamoto and Takashi Tezuka.
The work of composer Koji Kondo for both games reinforced the idea that musical themes could act as a compliment to game mechanics rather than simply a miscellaneous element.
Production of the NES lasted until 1995, and production of the Famicom lasted until 2003.
In total, around 62 million Famicom and NES consoles were sold worldwide.
During this period, Nintendo created a measure against piracy of its video games in the form of the Official Nintendo Seal of Quality, a seal that was added to their products so that customers may recognize their authenticity in the market.
By this time, Nintendo's network of electronic suppliers had extended to around thirty companies, among which were Ricoh - Nintendo's main source for semiconductors - and the Sharp Corporation.

Make sure the cloth is n't too wet so the purse is n't soaked.
Gentle circular motions will do the trick.
Smile and make eye contact.
Keep it simple.
Be sincere in your thanks.
Write a thank you note or card.
Avoid delegation.
End it if you ca n't stop fighting.
Consider ending it if you're growing distant and apart, and neither of you wants to fix it.
Compare life without your friend to life with a little bit less of them.
Join a team.
Practice empathy.
Balance your needs with the needs of others.
Show appreciation for other's kind actions towards you.
Different occasions and events call for different types of 'thank you' etiquette.
While there's no rule that says you must follow these guidelines, they have become tradition.
It is typical to send a 'thank you' note or card for the following reasons: Receiving any type of gift, including money.
The gift may be for your birthday, anniversary, graduation, house warming, holiday, etc..
Attending a dinner party or special occasion (i.e. Thanksgiving) at someone else's house.
It is customary to send a handwritten 'thank you' card to anyone who has done one of the following things for your wedding.
It is also customary to send the card within 3 months of the event, although it is much easier to keep yourself up - to - date if you send cards when you receive gifts instead of waiting until after the wedding is over.
Someone who has sent you a gift for your engagement, wedding shower or wedding, including money.
Someone who was a member of your wedding party (e.g. bridesmaid, maid of honour, flower girl, etc.).
Someone who hosted a party of some kind in your honour (e.g. wedding shower, engagement party, etc.).
Someone who helped you plan or execute your wedding, including the vendors and suppliers who made your wedding a success (e.g. baker, flower arranger, decorator, chef, etc.).
Anyone who went out of their way to help you while you were preparing and planning your wedding (e.g. the neighbour who mowed your lawn, etc.).
If you have been interviewed for a job, internship, or volunteer position, you should send a 'thank you' note or card to the interviewer as soon as possible after the interview is finished.
Make sure you personalize the card or note to be specific about the job for which you were interviewed, and even mention something specific from the interview.
Ensure that you've spelled everyone's name properly.
There would be nothing worse than sending a 'thank you' note after an interview and spelling the interviewer's name wrong.
Use formal greetings in your 'thank you' note unless the interviewer introduced themselves by their first name and insisted you call them that.
In the case of interview 'thank you' notes, it is not uncommon to send a personal email rather than an actual card or letter.
Logistically this might be the better option if physically getting a card or a note to the interviewer is difficult or might take too long.
Receiving any type of financial assistance in university or college is awesome.
Many of the scholarships and bursaries provided to students come from donations.
Whether donated from an individual, family, estate or organization, sending a 'thank you' note for providing you with the funds is a great way to show your appreciation.
If the scholarship or bursary was awarded via your school, the department who choose the recipients should be able to assist you in obtaining a mailing address for where to send the 'thank you' note.
Since these are not people you know personally, keep the 'thank you' letter formal and elegant, rather than casual.
Before sending the letter make sure you check (and double - check) that there are no spelling or grammar errors.
You may even want someone else to read it over for you in case you've missed something.
'Thank you' notes like this are best sent via formal business letter on nice paper, as opposed to a handwritten note or card.
Become educated in a variety of topics.
Focus on the positive.
Use assertive communication.

If you're saying 'thank you' in person, remember to smile and make eye contact with the person whom you're thanking.
These small gestures add a massive amount of sincerity to the 'thank you', showing your gratitude to someone else is awesome
Gushing over them and falling all over yourself to say 'thank you' is overdoing it, and could end up embarrassing the person you're trying to thank.
Keep your gratitude simple, to the point and pleasant.
You should be thanking someone because you honestly and sincerely are grateful for something they did.
You should n't be thanking someone because you were told to do it, or because you felt it was somehow required.
This is especially important for those who work in a retail environment where they may feel obligated to thank customers on a regular basis.
If you are n't actually sincere about the thanks, the customer can tell.
Even if it's your job to thank a customer, you can still make it sincere.
There are certain situations that require more than just an in - person 'thank you,' such as being treated to dinner, being giving a present, etc. , When these situations occur, a written 'thank you' is vital
Whomever treated you to this extra-special kindness deserves the same in return, and writing a 'thank you' note or card is the best way to show how much you really do appreciate what they did.
If you decide to use a card, blank ones work best in these situations.
Blank cards allow you to write a brief, but custom, note inside.
Whatever form your 'thank you' note takes, it should specifically mention the reason you're saying 'thank you.'
While emails can obviously be personalized, avoid sending an email in these situations.
Emails just are n't as sincere and well - meaning as an actual note or card.
Do not ask someone else to send someone a 'thank you' on your behalf, do it yourself.
It is n't a sincere 'thank you' if it is n't coming from you directly.
If you're a really busy person who does n't have a lot of extra time, have some custom 'thank you' cards made for you and keep them handy.
Or buy several boxes of blank cards to keep in your desk.
Let the water boil slowly so that the eggs do not crack from a rapid temperature shift.
The water will boil a bit more quickly with the lid on, but feel free to leave it off if you want to keep an eye on the eggs.
Make sure that the eggs do n't settle at the bottom, where they'll cook less evenly and break more easily.
Stir the water any time that you see the eggs begin to settle.
Use a wooden spoon to stir, and be very gentle so that you do n't crack the eggs.
As soon as the water reaches a full boil, turn the heat off and let the eggs sit in the hot water.
The heat of the water and the remaining warmth from the burner will be enough to finish cooking your eggs.
Leave the eggs in the pot for another 3 - 15 minutes, depending how hard or soft you like them: If you like your eggs soft - boiled, remove them from the water within three minutes.
The whites should be set, while the yolks should be runny and warm.
Be very gentle when you remove the eggs - scoop each egg out with a large spoon to avoid cracking.
If you like your eggs medium - boiled, take them out of the water in 5 - 7 minutes.
The yolks should be semi-soft in the center, and the whites should be very firm.
You should still handle the eggs gently, but you do n't need to worry as much about them cracking.
If you like your eggs hard - boiled, leave them in the hot water for 9 - 12 minutes.
The yolks should be firm all the way through, and you do n't need to worry about the eggs cracking.
If you want a solid but soft and bright yellow yolk, leave the eggs in water for 9 - 10 minutes.
If you'd like eggs with a harder, pale yellow center, leave them in for 11 - 12 minutes.
After 12 minutes, your yolk will develop grayish or greenish streaks.
The egg is still edible, and the streaks do n't have much effect on taste.
However, some people find green - and gray - streaked eggs less appetizing.
Consider buying a color - changing egg timer, a heat - sensitive indicator that you can place in the water with your boiling eggs.
You can find these timers online or at kitschy kitchen - supply stores.
If the egg cracks in the water while cooking, it should still be safe to eat - and, indeed, it may still cook normally if the crack is not too severe.
If an egg is cracked before you start cooking, do not bother to boil it.
Bacteria may well have penetrated the shell and infected the interior, making it potentially hazardous to your health.
Cream the butter and sugar.
Add the eggs and vanilla.
Stir in the cake flour.
Pour the batter into the pan.
Bake the cake for 1 hour 15 minutes.
Assess the situation before making suggestions.
Tell the person to take deep breaths.
Ask the person to count to 10.
Distract the person.
Suggest taking a walk.
If your friend is a danger to you or your health, screw social etiquette and end it immediately.
If your friend is manipulative / hurtful or you're afraid he or she will have a violent reaction to your friendship's end, just hit the brakes now.
Stop taking calls and texts, unfriend the person on Facebook, and do n't show up in places where you know that person will be.
If you're in danger, notify authorities (a boss, school officials, the police) immediately.
This is no longer a friendship worth handling alone.
To gracefully put a friendship out of its misery (or let it wilt, if that sounds too harsh), you should: Keep your conversations in safe, shallow territory.
Keep all of the emotional, personal baggage in your own bedroom and out of their house.
Lose touch with them.
Do n't make as big an effort to call or text.
Skip a phone call or two.
Do n't overdo it, of course.
But if you're not friends, you do n't need to be in constant communication.
Decline invitations to chill.
As the distance between you grows, stop spending time with the ex-friend.
Be a straight shooter.
Rather than leaving the person guessing why you are n't talking to him or her anymore, set aside a few minutes to talk to them.
If you're just not interested in hanging out with someone, this may be a bit extreme.
But if they are toxic to your life, old pals, or otherwise damaging your life you need to own up to your decision and tell them honestly.
This way you can hightail it out of there when the conversation is over, or if things get heated (which they hopefully will not).
Coffee shops and public parks are good choices.
Cut right to the chase - "I do n't think we should hang out anymore" is about as blunt, and effective, as it gets.
Do n't throw blame or talk trash about them.
For example, instead of accusing the person of drinking too much, go with 'I need time to focus more on my studies and less on partying.', Make sure they understand your position to
It's important to let your friend tell you what he or she thinks about the situation.
You spent a lot of time thinking about this.
Do n't undo it all in thirty seconds.
You may also be tempted to apologize for ending the friendship.
But unless you've done something wrong, there is no reason to be sorry for choosing to cut ties with someone.
Just get it done and get out of there.
No matter how you end a friendship, the person is likely to try to get in touch once or twice.
Let the person know if they are still welcome to talk to you or not.
If you are not crystal clear about your expectations, then do n't end things until you are.
If you're wishy - washy now, both of you will likely slip into old habits later.
If you are willing to keep in touch with this person, make it clear what kind of communication is cool with you.
You do n't have to ignore someone's very existence just because you do n't want to hang out anymore.
If you never want to speak to your former friend again, warn them of the consequences if they do n't listen.
And, like any other promise, make sure you follow through if they do.
Extremely long presentations will bore your audience, even if they are obsessed with your subject matter.
Extraneous slides with little to no content will also make the presentation drag and wear on the audience's interest.
Try to keep your presentation short and sweet, and make sure you are using the space on each slide to it's maximum potential.
Presentations are designed to be read, otherwise it would just be a speech.
Make sure that your audience will be able to easily read what you have written.
Curvy and extravagant fonts may look cool, but they'll make your audience just stop caring if they ca n't read it.
The best presentations are those that have a consistent, deliberate style.
use minimal amounts of color and stylistic accents to make your presentation stand out without being garish.
When in doubt, use one of the templates for a guide.
If you misspell a word, you might not notice it, but someone in your audience will be sure to spot it.
Spelling and grammar mistakes will lower your credibility, even subconsciously, so you'll want to work extra hard to ensure that everything is written clearly and correctly.
Get someone to help you proofread your presentation before you give it.
The PowerPoint is only part of your presentation.
The other part is you!
Work on your timing and ensure that each slide accurately sums up your talking points.
See this guide for more information on giving a successful presentation, either in class or at the office.
Bring your eggs to room temperature before cooking.
Use older eggs, if possible.
Release trapped gas to less the likelihood of cracking.
Sort the eggs and place them in a pot or saucepan.
Cover the eggs with cold tap water.
Add vinegar to the water.
It should provide information to the reader about the story or the characters.
Dialogue is a great way to prove character development or character information that your reader might not otherwise get.
Do n't do small talk about the weather or how each character is doing, even if that's something that comes up a lot in real conversations.
Now, a way in which small talk would be well used is to build up tension.
For example, a character really needs certain information from another character, but the second character insists upon the ritual of small talk, your reader and your character will be biting their nails in waiting to get to the good stuff.
All your dialogue should have a purpose.
As you're writing dialogue, ask yourself, "what does this add to the story? , " What am I trying to tell the reader about the character or the story? , If you do n't have an answer to those questions, scrap the dialogue
This is a big one that a lot of people have the tendency to do.
You think, what better way to get information across to my reader than by having my characters discuss it at length?
Hold it right there!
Background information needs to be added sporadically throughout the story.
For example of what not to do: Jane turned to Charles and said, "Oh Charles, remember when my father died a mysterious death and my family was turned out of our home by my evil aunt Agatha?"
You were only 12 - years - old and you had to drop out of school to help out your family.
"A better version of the above might go something like: Jane turned to Charles, her lips set in a grim line. , I heard from aunt Agatha today
But she was the one that kicked your family out of your house.
What did she want?
"" Who knows, but she started hinting things about my dad's death , "" Things
"Charles raised an eyebrow, She seemed to think his death was n't natural
"Conversations, especially in stories, are layered affairs.
There's usually more than one thing going on in them, so you want to make sure that you capture the subtext of each situation.
There are lots of ways to say things.
So, if you have a character that you want to say something like "I need you," try having them say as much, without actually saying it.
For example: Charles started for his car.
Jane placed a hand on his arm; she was chewing at her lip.
"Charles, I. , do you really have to go so soon , " she asked, withdrawing her hand.
We still have n't figured out what we're going to do.
"Do n't have your characters say everything they're feeling or thinking.
That will give away too much and wo n't allow for any suspense, or nuance.
You want your dialogue to be interesting and to keep your reader engaged in the story , This means skimming over background conversations, like people at the bus stop discussing the weather, and getting into the meaty conversations, like Jane's confrontation with treacherous Aunt Agatha
Engage your characters in arguments or have them say surprising things, as long as these things are in character for them.
Dialogue should be interesting.
If everyone is agreeing or asking and answering basic questions, the dialogue will get boring.
Intersperse your dialogue with action.
When people are having conversations they fiddle with things, laugh, wash the dishes, trip over things, and so on.
Adding these things to the dialogue will make it come alive.
For example: "You do n't think a healthy specimen like your daddy would've just sickened and died," Aunt Agatha said with a cackle.
Jane clung to the shreds of her temper, replying "Sometimes people get sick."
"And sometimes they get a little help from their friends."
Aunt Agatha sounded so smug Jane wanted to reach through the phone and wring her neck.
"if someone killed him, Aunt Agatha, do you know who? , " Oh, I've got a few notions, but I'll let you decide on your own.
Seal off all potential entry points.
Dispose of any remaining bat waste.
Check inhabitable spaces frequently.
Just about any team will do.
Join a sports league, or the welcoming committee in your neighborhood, or become a member of the French club after school.
No matter what activity you choose, being part of a team will help you see that working with others is important, and that many individual needs have to be balanced for success; not being selfish is a bit part of being a team player, so joining a team is a great place to practice your generosity and fairness.
Successful teamwork is also a critically important skill for many occupations.
Being part of a team will make it harder for you to put your needs above the needs of others as you may be outwardly criticized for your selfishness, which can bring down your entire team.
Empathy means to understand or share the feelings of another person, or to "put yourself in their shoes."
Empathy is a skill that can be worked on and strengthened, and can help you become less selfish.
Work on understanding another's point of view and suspending your own wants and needs; in doing so, you will likely become more generous and understanding.
Some ways to practice empathy include: Ask the other person how he is doing.
Instead of making assumptions or dismissing someone when he does something you do not agree with, ask him what is happening in his life.
Be curious and concerned about this person and see if you can understand his view of what is going on.
Imagine sympathetic reasons for the person's behavior.
If you are behind an older woman in line and she is taking a long time to check out, try to let go of judgement and frustration.
Perhaps the woman spends most of her days alone, and she's chatting with the clerk a little longer because she rarely sees anyone.
It does n't matter if this is the true reason she's holding up the line; what matters is that it helps you have empathy for the other person.
If you tend to put yourself first, making sure you get what you want, when you want it, you must start letting go of getting your way and think about finding balance in your relationships.
Start thinking about what your children, friends, or significant other might want, even if it's in conflict with your needs.
Whenever you're in a conflicting situation, think about what would make the other person happy instead of what would make you content.
Try to find a compromise, or try putting your needs aside.
Remember that everyone's needs, wants, and desires hold equal weight.
If your significant other really wants to watch her favorite team play baseball in the playoffs but you want to go to the movies, let her get what she wants this time.
If you find yourself taking advantage of or expecting things from others, like a friend who always gives you a ride, or someone who used her personal network to help get you a job, it's time to start saying "Thank you."
When someone does you a favor or is kind to you, show them gratitude by thanking them, either with your words, or even a note or small gift.
Let them know you really appreciate that they went out of their way to help you.
Try doing good deeds for your friends or even strangers, expecting nothing in return.
A truly selfless act of kindness is done without the expectation of reward or praise.
Think about finding a happy medium where everyone involved in the situation can get some of what they want.
Compromising is a skill that will help you succeed not only in friendships and relationships, but also in the business world.
When you're trying to solve a problem, think about who really wants it more.
If you and your girlfriend are picking a movie to watch, and she's been dying to see one movie, while you're only lukewarm on your different choice, let her have her way.
If you find that you do n't feel so strongly about your position, then reach an agreement that favors the other people.
Then next time you really want something, it will be your turn.
Before your reach an agreement, make sure that everyone has time to express his or her views.
This can help you have a more balanced perspective before you reach a decision.
Let a friend borrow your favorite dress.
Share your lunch with a friend who forgot his.
Let your boyfriend use your stereo for an afternoon.
Get in the habit of sharing something you were previously very possessive of.
This will help you show others that they matter to you and will make it easier for you to be giving.
It will change your self - perspective from being someone who is selfish to being someone who is selfless.
Take the time to volunteer in your community, whether it's through school, work, or an independent activity.
You can work in your school library, clean up a local park, work in a soup kitchen, or spend time teaching adults and children learn to read.
Volunteering is a broadening your perspective of the world by seeing how others are in need and how you can make a difference.
Volunteering will also make you more appreciative of what you have when you see that not everyone is lucky enough to have all of the things you do.
Make a goal of volunteering at least once a week, and see how much less selfish you feel.
Pack the swimsuit you've picked out and an extra change of clothes.
The extra change of clothes is for the ride home, so you wo n't be all wet and sandy.
Also, make sure your comfortable enough to spend all day in the clothes you wear down.
Having a changes of clothes means you can head somewhere else after the beach.
Do n't forget to include good footwear.
Take sandals for the beach and water shoes for the ocean so you're ready for anything.
You do n't want to ruin your beach trip with a bad sunburn.
Plus, protecting yourself from the sun will keep your skin looking younger as you age and guard against skin cancer.
Start with a sunscreen of at least 15 SPF.
Check to make sure it protects against both UVA and UVB rays.
Do n't forget to add a lip balm with sunscreen to protect your lips.
Make sure to reapply it frequently, especially after sweating or jumping in the water.
Use clothing for protection.
Hats and sunglasses offer much needed protection for your face and eyes, but wearing a coverup with long sleeves can also offer protection.
If coverups are n't your thing, take a beach umbrella or tent / gazebo instead.
A beach chair or a towel is appropriate, but if you choose a towel, it should be separate from the one you'll be using to dry off with.
If you choose a plastic chair, you may still want to bring the extra towel to keep your chair from getting too hot while you are away.
You could also bring an old blanket you do n't mind getting sandy.
Another option is an old fitted king - size sheet.
You can put things like bags and coolers in the corners, so that the sheet makes a cozy little playpen for you and your family.
Of course, you hope no one will get injured, but taking a basic first aid kit will offer you some relief if someone gets hurt.
You can buy a first aid kit ready - made or make your own.
Make sure you have things like bandages, antibiotic ointment, pain relief pills, and a thermometer, as well as anti-diarrhea medicine.
You may also want antihistamines.
Make sure you have an assortment of bandages, including small adhesive ones as well as roller bandages, gauze pads, and medical tape.
You should also have things like antiseptic packets, hydrocortisone packets, non-latex gloves, and compress dressings.
Also, make sure you pack any common over-the-counter medications you use frequently.
You'll need a place to stash your valuables away from the water and the sand.
Leave anything irreplaceable behind that you can so you do n't lose or damage it on the beach.
Another trick to protect your valuables is to clean out an old sunscreen bottle , Use it to hide valuables you do n't want anyone to steal, and as a bonus, it keeps them dry
You can also stash electronics in zip - top bags for protection.
For beach toys, find a net bag so sand can be left on the beach.
Pack all the food in a cooler with ice.
Complete the tasks which will benefit you the most in the long run first.
You'll need to identify the difference between "high - value" tasks (those which will benefit you the most in the long term) versus "low - value" tasks (tasks which may be easier, but will offer fewer benefits).
Avoiding the less pleasant aspects of work does n't make them disappear.
Building up a huge hunk of the bad stuff to deal with all at once, after you've completed the enjoyable stuff, is just going to leave a sour taste in your mouth at the end of a project.
Make lists.
Enough ca n't be said about the anti-procrastination benefits of seeing your work in front of you, and crossing it off as you finish it.
Each list should be long enough to keep your workload in perspective, but not so long that your day feels paralyzingly demanding.
One tactic is to divvy your seemingly unmanageable task into manageable chunks, then sprinkle those less - enjoyable aspects of a task into that other stuff that you really like.
Stick to a schedule: physically writing out to - dos and calendars is n't necessary for everyone, but establishing a regular schedule can help you efficiently take care of business.
Scheduling the work you dislike for a specific day - and then pushing it out of your mind to avoid stress on other days - might help you conquer unhelpful procrastination habits.
Follow through on the tasks you begin.
Finishing one project will teach you exponentially more than a dozen fizzled - out attempts, even if you never want to look at that project again.
Sometimes you'll find yourself bogged down in work that seems, now that you've toiled away at it for a week, misguided in its goal.
If the project has a projected timeline that will take up a great deal of your time moving forward, it's sometimes best to reassess whether you're spending your time well (see above, about "high - value" tasks versus "low - value" tasks).
So how do you know when you should drop a project?
Honest introspection, and self - awareness.
If you find yourself thinking this often - and you've got a string of unfinished projects in your wake - it might be a sign you need to buckle down and see this to the end.
Whether they've done well or screwed up, a successful businessman must be able to take responsibility for their actions.
It signals to both employees and employers a willingness to deal openly and responsibly with the tasks at hand.
Squirming away from negative fallout your missteps have made endears you to no one, and can have disastrous consequences on the relationships you've made in the business world.
Buy food labeled 100% organic.
Recognize fruit and vegetable label numbers.
Buy 100% grass - fed meat.
Seek products that are specifically labeled as non-GMO or GMO - free.
Buy whole foods.
Grow your own food.
Take some time to shave.
Skip foods that bloat.
Gratitude is a little different from a simple 'thank you.'
Gratitude is about being thankful and polite, but it's also about being courteous, generous, and appreciative.
It's about being concerned for people other than yourself.
Expressing our gratitude towards others can help influence a situation positively and even change the behaviour of others.
The first step to expressing gratitude towards others is being able to understand what you are truly grateful for.
Writing down the things you're grateful for in a journal is a great way to help yourself understand how you feel about yourself and others.
Writing in the journal can take as little as a few minutes a day to list the 3 things you're grateful about at that moment.
You can use the idea of a gratitude journal to help kids develop a better understanding of gratitude and being grateful.
Help them write 3 things they're grateful for every night before bed.
If they're too young to write, have them draw a picture of the things they're grateful for.
Challenge yourself to express some form of gratitude 5 times every day.
Your gratitude should be expressed towards everyone, not just your family members and close friends.
If you think about it, there are a lot of people who help you out every day that probably almost never hear words of gratitude, like bus drivers, receptionists, telemarketers, people who hold the door open, people who give up their seat on the bus, cleaners, etc..
When expressing this gratitude, remember to use the person's name (if you know it), what you're grateful for and why you're grateful for it.
For example, 'Thanks for holding the elevator Sue, I was concerned I'd be late for my meeting, now I'm going to be right on time!'
If there's a practical reason why you ca n't express your gratitude in person, express it in your head or write it down.
Gratitude does n't only have to be shown the typical way (e.g. saying thank you), it can be much more.
Every now and again look for a new way to express your gratitude for someone by doing something you have n't done before, or have n't done in a long time.
For example: making dinner one night when you notice your partner is exhausted; taking care of your kids one night so your partner can go out with friends; volunteering to be the designated driver; offering to host the family Christmas party one year, etc..
You probably have memories of your mom or dad reminding your to tell someone 'thank you' when they gave you a treat or a candy when you were little.
Being thankful or grateful is n't always the first thing on a kid's mind, but it's important for them to learn.
The following four step method can work great to teach your kids about gratitude: Tell you kids about gratitude, what it means and why it's important.
Use your own words and give examples.
Demonstrate your gratitude skills for your kids.
You can do this as an exercise or in 'real life.'
Help your kids practice giving gratitude to someone else.
If you have more than one kid, have them each give examples and provide feedback to each other.
Do n't stop encouraging your kids to be grateful.
Give them positive reinforcement when they've done a good job.
As hard as it may be to do, you need to also show gratitude towards people who might upset you or drive you a little crazy.
Remember to be patient when doing this, and avoid sounding like you're being sarcastic.
People who drive you up the wall might have completely different perspectives on some things.
While you may not agree or like those perspectives, they're still valid opinions.
Be grateful for the fact that they've shared these opinions with you and you've learned to look at a situation from a different perspective.
Even if these people drive you crazy, there's probably still something about them that you admire.
They may be annoying, but maybe they're always punctual or really organized.
Focus on these positive aspects when talking to these people.
Consider the fact that dealing with this annoying person is actually teaching you some new skills.
Be grateful that you're learning to be patient and calm in frustrating situations.
Being grateful and being able to express gratitude can really have an amazing effect on you and those around you.
Gratitude is linked to happiness - those who are happier tend to be more grateful.
Having someone be grateful towards you can make you feel great.
Thinking about what you're grateful for helps you focus on the positive things in your life, not the negative.
Spending time writing down what you're grateful for right before bed can help you sleep better.
Not only do you spend the last few moments before you go to sleep thinking about positive things, but you're able to get your thoughts out of your head and down on paper.
Being grateful tends to make you more empathetic.
This may be because grateful people focus on positive emotions instead of negative ones, so they do n't get as upset when someone is mean to them.
These are the products that are most likely to be genetically modified.
Crops that are genetically modified include soy, corn, canola, sugar beets, cotton, Hawaiian papaya, zucchini and yellow summer squash, and alfalfa.
Soy is not limited to actual soybeans.
Make sure that your soy milk, edamame, and tofu have a 100% certified organic label.
Corn includes corn flour, meal, oil, starch, gluten, and syrup.
Canola oil is also known as Rapeseed oil.
This ingredient can be found in a lot of processed foods.
If you usually use Canola oil for cooking, try using olive oil instead.
Sugar beets are found in any sugar that is not 100% cane sugar.
Make sure you read the label.
Cottonseed oil is a common ingredient in vegetable oil , shortening, and margarine
Many dairy products contain GMOs.
Some farmers inject their cows with a genetically modified hormones rBGH / rBST and / or are fed genetically modified grains.
You should look for dairy products that say rBGH or rBST free.
Hawaiian papayas are genetically modified.
You should buy papayas grown in other regions like the Caribbean , We usually do not directly ingest alfalfa
Alfalfa is grown to feed dairy cows and other animals.
Both organic alfalfa and genetically engineered alfalfa are grown.
You can avoid genetically engineered alfalfa by eating grass fed meat and dairy products that are 100% certified organic.
Not only are the actual crops genetically modified, but an ingredient that is derived from the crop is genetically modified as well.
If you are buying processed foods, you should read the food label and avoid any of these ingredients: amino acids (synthetic form, not naturally occurring in protein), aspartame, ascorbic acid (synthetic vitamin c), sodium ascorbate, citric acid, sodium citrate, ethanol, natural and artificial flavorings, high fructose corn syrup, hydrolyzed vegetable protein, lactic acid, maltodextrins, molasses, monosodium glutamate, sucrose, textured vegetable protein, xantham gum, vitamins, and yeast products.
About 75% of processed foods at the grocery store contain these ingredients.
This includes foods like soda, cookies, bread, and chips.
You can avoid these derivatives by cooking your food from scratch and carefully buying your food.
There is no way for you to know every food that contains GMOs.
If you are unsure, you should consult a GMO food guide.
The Center for Food Safety has created an iPhone and Android app that can help you avoid GMOs when you are shopping.
You can also download or use their online guide.
If you eat out, you should ask the manager or your waitress if they use organic ingredients or if they use GMO ingredients.
If they do not use organic foods, you should avoid tofu, edamame, corn tortillas, corn chips, and any other products that contain corn or soy.
Most of the items containing sugar will contain GMO derivatives.
You should also ask what type of oil is used for cooking.
If they say vegetable oil, margarine, cottonseed oil, or corn oil, ask if they can cook your food with olive oil instead.
Pull the shrub out of the ground using a chain.
Kill off the shrub using chemicals.
Find out if anyone is interested in collecting the shrub.
Stop and take deep breaths.
Practice what works.
Verify that it's bats you're dealing with.
Be on the lookout for droppings.
Research the types of bats found in your area.
Inspect for places where bats might be getting in.
Pound cake is one of the simplest cakes to bake.
Place the butter and sugar in a mixing bowl and beat them together until the mixture is light, fluffy and creamy.
Keep beating the mixture until the eggs are completely incorporated.
Keep the electric mixer on low or use a wooden spoon to stir the flour in a bit at a time until it's just incorporated.
Be careful not to overmix it.
Use a spatula to scrape down the sides of the bowl.
The cake is finished when a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean , Enjoy your delicious homemade cake
The first thing you want to do is to remove the grease, so that you can reach the stain underneath.
There are a number of ways to do this and which you choose should be based on preference and what is available to you.
Try: Soaking the shirt in dish detergent.
Cover the collar stain in regular liquid dish soap, like Dawn.
Let it soak for an hour (or more) and then rinse it out.
The shirt will probably need to be wet first, to really help the soap soak in.
Using Fast Orange or similar degreasers.
Spray them on, allow them to soak for 5 minutes, and then rinse them away.
Be careful of very harsh products though, as these can irritate the skin.
Using shampoo for greasy hair.
Using shampoo designed for greasy hair in a similar process as described above for Dawn can yield surprising results.
Adding to the grease.
If none of the other methods work, some people swear by adding more grease to the shirt collar.
In theory, the new fat molecules bond to the old ones and help drawn them out.
Use products like lanolin hand cleaners, which can be found at drug stores or car shops.
After you've gotten the grease out, you should be left with the actual stain.
It should be much easier to remove with the grease gone.
Again, there are a few different approaches.
This is a common, basic, stain removal product available at many stores.
Spray it on, let it set, and wash the shirt as normal.
This is another common cleaning product.
If you do n't have Oxyclean, you can make your own: it's basically just baking soda and hydrogen peroxide mixed together.
Oxyclean will need to be placed on the stain and may need to be worked around to get the lifting effect.
Though it certainly should n't be your first option, you will likely get better results if you agitate the stain.
Use an old toothbrush to gently scrub at the stain while it is covered in the degreaser or stain - remover.
As long as you do n't do this too often (rely on preventative measures), your shirt should be fine and remain unharmed.
After you've used the degreaser and stain - remover, you can wash the shirt as normal.
Do not dry the shirt, however, until you've done as much as you can to remove the stain.
A dryer is a great way to set - in stains.
If you're not having any luck, try taking the shirt to a professional dry cleaner.
They may have better ways of removing the stain, and a single shirt rarely costs very much money at all.

Once you've removed the stain to the best of your ability, take a new damp cloth and remove the remaining soap.
It's important that you know the fundamentals of your industry, though that does n't always necessitate an MBA.
A lack of post-secondary education can be a deal breaker for many prospective employers, however.
Enrolling in business classes, even if they're at the learning annex or a community college, shows a determination to learn that will definitely appeal, and should be highlighted on your resume.
A degree in business makes sense for any businessman, though you should research the industries you're interested in before declaring your major.
Some positions may prefer more specialized degrees, so do your homework.
Trade schools.
If the business you're interested in specializes in a particular trade, you might be best off immersing yourself in the trade.
Lectures and seminars.
Listening to the advice of those who are successful in their field can be enlightening.
Check the schedule at local colleges for speaking tours, or search online for industry - related speaking engagements in your city.
Staying up - to - date on what the top minds in the industry are saying is essential, even if you already think you're at the top of your game.
Success in the business world means going the extra mile.
There are multiple resources available to you online to further immerse yourself in further learning, if you find you're finishing your schoolwork (or the work at your side job) with time to spare.
Never rest on your laurels: think about what should come next.
Many employers nowadays are prioritizing the skills a candidate brings to the table over their GPA or higher education.
Research example resumes for positions you'd like to hold, and put effort into developing those skills in your free time.
The extra mile should n't come at the expense of every other aspect of your life, though.
Finding time to reward yourself for hard work will instill better habits in you for the future.
Developing a relationship with a professional whose career you admire is one of the more direct and efficient forms of networking.
Establishing the connection might prove difficult, but reach out through whatever means are available to you.
With a local business owner, you might just try walking up to them in their place of business and asking!
Introduce yourself as an aspiring businessman and admirer of their accomplishments, and ask if they have any time available to speak with you on the subject.
At school, you might find a mentor in a professor.
Never neglect the wealth of knowledge which exists in a university, and do n't make the mistake of thinking you're only allowed to learn during class.
Approach your professor for advice during their office hours.
Some companies employ on - the - job mentoring programs which pair recruits up with experienced workers.
Take advantage of these, and look to them not as a burden but as an opportunity to learn and excel.
When you do n't yet have the experience, use internships to get your foot in the door.
Do n't balk at unpaid positions if they can build the bridges you need to succeed in the long - term, and the hours wo n't leave you penniless in the short - term.
Internships provide many college students their first opportunities to network on the job with working professionals.
Low - paying entry level jobs are simply the price to be paid in the business world right now, when true "entry level" jobs wo n't give you a chance without a few years of experience already under your belt.
Do balk at unpaid positions which do n't present themselves as pathways to success, either within the company or by opening further doors to you.
If you're traveling in a group, bring something you can all do.
For instance, a deck of waterproof cards is great for the beach, as long as it's not too windy.
You could also bring a board game that does n't have too many parts.
A game like Twister, for instance, would be great for the beach.
Remember to include fun for the kids in your group.
On the beach, all you need are some simple toys, such as buckets, shovels, and other cheap toys.
Your kids will have a blast in the sand and water.
Music is a great way to keep people entertained.
For a simple solution, you could bring along a waterproof, battery - powered radio, like a shower radio.
However, you can also use waterproof bluetooth speakers so you can play music from your phone.
You'll enjoy just lounging for a bit, but you might also want something to enjoy all on your own.
For instance, take a light book you've been meaning to dive into.
The beach is the perfect time to do it.
If you take an e-reader, make sure it's okay in the glare of the sun, and that you have a portable charger for it if you need it.
You may also want a portable charger for your phone.
Slip the e-reader into a zip - top bag to protect it.
You could also take activity books such as crossword puzzles and Sudoku books.
If you're planning to stay at the beach for a few hours, you're going to want some snacks and drinks to get you through.
Keep it fairly simple.
If you choose anything too complicated that requires assembly, you'll likely end up with sand in your food.
Some good snacks to take include fruit, granola bars, vegetable sticks, and bottles of water.
Skip the sodas as those do n't hydrate as well.
In fact, if you're planning on staying all day, consider just packing lunch.
Though you can take a cooler for drinks, you might want to pick something that wo n't spoil easily, such as a peanut butter and jelly.
Bring a small bag for any trash you may accumulate.
It may be difficult to find a trashcan at the beach.
When you get to the beach, you need to stake out a claim.
It's good to go early in the day, when it's less crowded , That way, you'll have more opportunity to find a good spot
Pick a spot near the water but not so near you'll be overrun if the tide comes in.
If the beach has chairs or umbrellas for rent, consider renting one to make life easier.
Stick with like - minded beach goers.
That is, if you're there to party and have fun with your friends, pick an area where people are being louder and playing music.
If you prefer a quiet place to read, try to find a more secluded spot.
If you're there with your family, look for other families to be near, so your kids can play together.
If you're in a wilderness situation, there are likely branches all around you.
A straight stick at least 2 feet (0.61 m) long will cast a clean, visible shadow so you can find your direction.
The thickness of the stick can vary, but something around 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) should work in most situations.
If the sky is overcast, a thicker stick can help cast a more visible shadow.
Insert the stick so it's standing straight up.
If the ground is hard, poke a hole with a knife or other tool you may have.
Notice how the stick casts a shadow - that's the shadow you'll use to find your direction.
Use rocks or dirt to keep the stick standing up straight.
It's important that the shadow is cast on flat ground, free of grass and other vegetation.
If the ground is uneven or grassy, the shadow will be distorted.
Clear some ground if you have to.
This rock marks the shadow's original location.
Mark the original location because as the sun moves across the sky, the shadow will move too.
Since the sun moves across the sky east to west, it's casting a shadow on the opposite side.
This means that the shadow's original location is your western-most point.
This allows enough time for the sun to move across the sky.
If the shadow has n't visibly moved enough after 20 minutes, wait another 10.
If you have no way to keep time, then just keep an eye on the shadow.
When you see that it's moved, you can mark the new location and proceed.
As the sun moves, the shadow will move east.
Put either a rock or stick at the end of the shadow to mark it's new location.
Remember, use something that wo n't blow away.
If you lose both shadow locations, you'll have to start over.
Since the sun is moving west across the sky, the shadow's new location will be further east.
Connecting these 2 rocks creates an east - west line, the first step in finding which way north is.
To connect the 2 rocks, you can either draw a straight line in the dirt or lay a straight stick between them.
This creates a compass so you do n't forget which side is which.
Remember that the directions on a compass are North, East, South, and West in a clockwise direction.
If you forget the order of the directions on a compass, remember the phrase "Never Eat Soggy Watermelon," a memory device to remember the directions.
When you're in this position, your front will be facing north and your back will be facing south.
This completes the compass.
The north you're facing is true north, because you've used the sun rather than the Earth's magnetic field.
If you want to keep track of these directions, mark an 'N' where your front is facing and an 'S' where your back is facing to keep track.
This method works the same in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres.
The only difference is that in the Northern Hemisphere, the sun will be at your back, and in the Southern Hemisphere the sun will be in front of you.
Start with 1s and 0s.
Memorize the multiplication table.
Multiply and regroup the columns.
Another approach that involves less digging is to wrap a length of chain around the root stump and pull it from the ground using a car jack or a towing vehicle.
It will help if you can mattock out the roots a little to dislodge the root from the ground.
You'll need to be aware of where your water and power lines are to avoid accidentally damaging these.
Cut off the majority of the shrub above ground, leaving only a fairly short length of stump above ground.
Purchase a glyphosate - based shrub killing chemical treatments from the garden store.
This treatment needs to be applied fairly soon after cutting - it wo n't work on an old stump that's been sitting in the garden for years.
Handle carefully and follow manufacturers instructions.
Treat the stump over the autumn and winter, when the sap is n't rising.
It may be necessary to drill holes in the woody stump to pour the treatment into.
You'll need to have considerable patience as the stump may take a good while to die away and the area will not be suitable for immediate replanting.
Although you might want rid of your shrub, there may be someone in your local area who would love to have it.
Take a good digital photo and you may be surprised who's interested!
Do n't let the stain set.
Change your hygiene routine.
Switch shampoos.
Use white shirts.
Make sweat strips.
Add transitions between slides.
Add backgrounds.
Add images.
Add links.
Embed video.
While the eggs are cooking in the hot water, fill a large bowl with cold water.
Dissolve another 1/4 - 1/2 teaspoon of salt in the water, then add ice to lower the temperature further.
When the eggs are done cooking, you will carefully move them into this bowl to stop them from cooking any more.
After your eggs have cooked for the desired amount of time, gently drain the hot water from the pan, then move the eggs to the bowl of ice - water to stop the cooking process.
Remove the eggs one by one with a slotted spoon to avoid cracking.
Carefully drop the eggs into the bowl of ice water to bring their temperature down.
Once the eggs are cool enough to hold in your hand, put them in the refrigerator for 20 - 30 minutes to loosen the shells.
If you're not particular about how pretty your peeled eggs are - or if you like your eggs warm - you can skip the refrigerator and start peeling them immediately after chilling them.
Spin an egg on a table to test whether it is hard - boiled without breaking it open.
If the egg twirls quickly and easily, it is hard - boiled.
If it wobbles, let it cook for longer.
Press each egg into a clean, flat surface and roll it in your hand to crack the shell.
Start peeling from the fatter end of the egg, where there should be a small empty space under the shell.
This makes it slightly easier to peel.
Rinse the eggs under cold water as you peel them.
This helps keep bits of shell and membrane from sticking to the egg.
It is usually easier to peel eggs once they are cracked.
Put the eggs back in the pot with the lid on.
Shake the pot back and forth to crack the shells before you begin peeling.
You may need to do this several times to crack them all.
Pinch off a small section of shell and membrane from the large end.
Slip the spoon inside the shell and membrane so that it cups the egg.
Then, simply slide the spoon around to peel off sections of shell.
The eggs are ready to eat as soon as you peel them.
Store the leftover eggs in a sealed container, and cover them with a wet paper towel.
Change the paper towel each day to keep the eggs from drying out.
Eat the eggs within four to five days, before they go bad.
You can also store the eggs in cold water.
Change the water each day to keep the eggs from breaking down.
You can store hard - boiled eggs for several days before you crack and peel them.
Keep in mind, however, that they tend to grow somewhat dry and rubbery.
It's usually better to keep peeled eggs moist in the fridge than to leave the eggs unpeeled.
If you do n't have an email address that can be used with Google services then you should select the option that says "I do not use these other services."
You can then create a new Google account and verify the email address by logging in through Gmail and clicking on the verify link.
If you are creating a work advertisement, but Google suggests you use your personal ID, you may want to back out and use a business ID.
This will take you to the Your First Campaign page to set up your advertising.
Enter your website address.
You may choose to enter your home page (example, www.example.com), or another part of your website (example: www.example.com/buynow) , Where you send the visitors is up to you, and depends on what you are trying to accomplish
Enter your target audience.
There are three parts to a target audience: Location.
Google will default usually to your country.
If you are selling a local service, you would simply remove the country and add the name of your city.
Or if you sell internationally, you can choose other countries.
Google defaults you to running ads on all websites in the Google network, including the tens of thousands of websites where you see "Ads By Google."
If you only want to show on Google and its limited 'search partners,' uncheck the box that says "Display Network."
This is the most challenging part of advertising on Google for new advertisers.
A keyword is simply a word or set of words that you think people will be typing into Google to find your product or service.
For example, if you are selling shoes, you might pick keywords like, "red shoes," "Nike shoes," and "buy new shoes."
If you want to spend $50 a day, simply enter $50.
You want to enter a number large enough that, you will get a good sense if your ads are working, but not so much that you get burned financially.
Realize you wo n't know the actual price you will pay per click until you start.
The prices are set in a complicated auction process where what you actually pay will be all over the map.
As an example, if you are advertising on keywords for popular songs in India, you may pay only one cent per click.
If you are advertising for insurance or trying to market a weight loss scam, you could be paying $10 per click or more.
You can change the setting to "I'll set my bids manually."
Automatically setting the price you pay per click sounds alarming, but it usually works fine.
Google tries to give you the maximum value for your money.
If you want to manually choose the price you pay per click (CPC), you will need to enter a number for each keyword.
Here is where you write your actual ad that people on Google will see.
Write something catchy that makes your readers want to click on the ad.
The ad should be catchy, yet truthful.
Google will not approve your ad if it violates certain policies.
As examples, the ad can not promise something that is not true (do n't say Free iPad giveaway if you do n't have one.)
Similarly they forbid too many capital letters, overactive punctuation and the like.
In the add, tell people about your business.
Add a call - to - action such as "Call Us" or "Buy Tickets."
Use relevant keywords within the ad text.
These are the words that you want people to type on the Google search engine when you want your ad to appear.
Hit "Save and Continue" when you are done.
Here you can review everything before you spend any money.
Examine the ads, keywords, locations of your ads etc., and confirm they are correct.
Accept the terms and conditions for using AdWords.
If you are in an industry or a country with a lot of fraud or bad actors, review may take a few days.
Google is wary of ads that hint of weight loss, lawsuits, pharmaceutical sales, sex, firearms and others.
Other advertising networks like Bing and Facebook allow some things that Google does not.
Even if you are legitimate, anything close to those topics will come in for extra scrutiny.
Uncheck the "Block all cookies" box.
Lacking dynamic or developed interests or hobbies might contribute to your seeming immature.
Finding something that you enjoy doing and becoming an "expert" at it can make you seem more experienced and mature.
It will also give you something to talk about with others, whether or not they also participate in your hobby.
Try to keep your hobbies active and productive.
It's a lot of fun to watch a TV show marathon, but it is n't necessarily the best use of your time.
This does n't mean you ca n't enjoy movies, TV, and video games, but they should n't be the only things you spend your time on.
Hobbies can increase your self - esteem and boost your creativity.
There's basically no limit to the types of things you can do!
Get a camera and learn photography.
Pick up a musical instrument.
Practice a new language.
Learn to beatbox.
Start a live - action roleplaying group.
Just make sure that whatever you choose is something you enjoy doing, or it'll become a chore rather than a hobby.
Part of maturity is being able to assess your current strengths, determine areas that you need to improve, and set goals for the future.
Keep the future in mind and let it inform the choices you are making about your life right.
Once you have set goals that are clear, actionable, and measurable, take action to work towards them.
Setting goals can seem overwhelming, but do n't worry!
It just takes a little time and planning.
Start by figuring out what you want to improve.
For example, maybe you want to start boosting your resume for college.
This is the basis for your goals.
First you need to think about a few categories: Who, What, When, Where, How, and Why.
This is who will be involved in achieving your goals.
Obviously, you are the primary person here.
However, this category could also include a tutor, a volunteer coordinator, or a counselor.
What do you want to achieve?
It's important to be as specific as possible in this step.
"Prepare for college" is way too big.
You'll never get started on a huge vague goal like that.
Instead, choose a few specifics that will help you achieve that bigger goal, like "Do a volunteer activity" and "Participate in an extracurricular activity."
This helps you know when specific parts of your plan have to be done , Knowing this will help keep you on track
For example, if you want to volunteer, you need to know if there's a deadline to apply, when the activities are, and when you'll be able to do them.
For the volunteering example, you might choose to work at an animal shelter.
In this step you identify how you'll achieve each stage of your goal.
For example, what is the process for contacting the shelter to volunteer?
How will you get to the animal shelter?
How will you balance your volunteering with your other responsibilities?
You have to think about answers to these types of questions.
This is probably the most important part, believe it or not.
You're more likely to achieve a goal when it's meaningful to you and you can see how it fits in the "big picture."
Figure out why this goal is important.
For example, "I want to volunteer at the animal shelter so that I can make my resume more attractive for pre-vet college programs."
You do not have to be serious all of the time in order to be mature.
Real maturity is knowing your audience and figuring out when it's appropriate to be silly and when it's important to be serious.
It's good to have different levels of silly so you can scale your actions appropriately.
You need time to blow off steam and get goofy.
Give yourself a little time every day (say, after school) to indulge in wacky hijinks.
Understand that silliness usually is n't appropriate in formal situations, such as school, church, at work, and especially at funerals.
You're expected to be paying attention, not pranking people.
Being silly in these situations will usually communicate immaturity.
However, informal situations like hanging out with your friends, or even time with your family, can be a great time to get silly.
It can even help you bond with each other.
Establish some parameters for when it is okay and when it is not okay to play a joke or be silly.
We all have to live in the world together.
If you do things to intentionally annoy others, or if you do whatever you want without keeping the feelings of others in mind, people may view you as immature.
Trying to remember the needs and wants of other people around you will help you cultivate a reputation as a mature and respectful individual.
Being respectful of others does n't mean you have to let them walk all over you.
It does mean that you need to listen to others and treat them the way you'd like to be treated.
Show that you're the bigger person by walking away.
Your friends will influence your behavior.
Make sure that you're associating with people who will make you a better person, instead of spending time with people who only drag you down.
Make sure the area is completely dry.
When you miss class, you have to learn the concepts either from a classmate or from your textbook.
You'll never get as good of an overview from your friends or from the text as you will from your teacher.
Come to class on time.
In fact, come a little early and open your notebook to the right place, open your textbook and take out your calculator so that you're ready to start when your teacher is ready to start.
Only skip class if you are sick.
When you do miss class, talk to a classmate to find out what the teacher talked about and what homework was assigned.
If your teacher works problems at the front of your class, then work along with the teacher in your notebook.
Do n't just write down the problems , Also write down anything that the teacher says that increases your understanding of the concepts
Work any sample problems that your teacher posts for you to do.
When the teacher walks around the classroom as you work, answer questions.
Participate while the teacher is working a problem.
Do n't wait for your teacher to call on you.
Volunteer to answer when you know the answer, and raise your hand to ask questions when you're unsure of what's being taught.
When you do the homework the same day, the concepts are fresh on your mind.
Sometimes, finishing your homework the same day is n't possible , Just make sure that your homework is complete before you go to class
Go to your teacher during his or her free period or during office hours.
If you have a Math Center at your school, then find out the hours that it's open and go get some help.
Join a study group.
Good study groups usually contain 4 or 5 people at a good mix of ability levels.
If you're a "C" student in math, then join a group that has 2 or 3 "A" or "B" students so that you can raise your level.
Avoid joining a group full of students whose grades are lower than yours.
No one can live without stress but the key is to live comfortably with stress without letting it overwhelm you.
If you do n't sweat the small stuff, practice mindfulness, and stay healthy, you will be stronger to deal with hard days.
Look at what you can improve.
People who respond positively to constructive feedback tend to learn, grow, and be more successful.
Practice asking for constructive feedback from friends or trusted coworkers.
Provide them with an aspect of your life that you feel safe using as a topic, and ask them to constructively critique you, so that you can become accustomed to receiving and using feedback to your advantage.
For example, have a colleague look over a spreadsheet you create at work and ask for input on how to improve it to make your work more efficient.
Or, cook your favorite dish for a trusted friend and ask for his thoughts on your presentation and plating.
Be sure to not make excuses for your life situation.
Instead, adapt, be confident and stop making excuses.
Develop your problem solving abilities.
Write out what is bothering you, brainstorm how many different ways you can approach the problem, assess the pros and cons of each approach, implement an approach, and evaluate the outcome.
Take away useful lessons from negative events and situations without becoming fixated on the problems.
Disregard any unhelpful additional information.
For example, if you arrived late for work one morning and your boss made a sarcastic comment, focus on the concrete aspects you can work on, such as punctuality, and ignore any hot - headed remarks.
Being mindful is being aware of the present moment and it distances you from the immediacy of your emotions.
To practice mindfulness is to more fully appreciate the present and reduce feelings of pain and past hurts.
An excellent way to practice becoming mindful is to sit quietly with a raisin in the palm of your hand.
Feel the raisin's weight.
Smell the raisin.
By focusing on the raisin, you are becoming truly mindful in the present.
Apply this practice to everything you approach in life.
If you do n't have a raisin, focus on your surroundings, your breath, and you physical sensations.
Shift your perspective to being more open to possibilities and reduce automatic negative thoughts.
If you can shift your perspective and view things at face value, you may realize that someone who missed a coffee date may not be trying to hurt your feelings but maybe had an unexpected emergency arise and forgot to phone you.
Studies have shown that the key factor to happiness is gratitude, or being thankful.
Gratitude increases resilience and improves your immunity so you'll feel much stronger to deal with life's curveballs.
Every night before bed, write down three things for which you are thankful.
Review this list whenever life feels hard.
Examine whether that grudge or sadness is serving a positive function in your present life.
If it is not, let go of the past and live more purposefully in the present.
List the reasons you might be angry at yourself, then read the list as if you are observer and let the feelings come and go.
Be kind to yourself.
Develop empathy for others.
If you are feeling hurt by something someone else says or does, try to put yourself in that person's shoes.
It can be difficult to empathize with someone who's just hurt your feelings, but considering his point of view and what he might be going through can be a calming, reasonable exercise.
Even young children can learn how to deal with the tough times in life.
Give them problem - solving opportunities.
Teach them that mistakes are normal and are opportunities to learn.
Teach your children empathy.
Increased empathy toward others decreases negative automatic thoughts and increases resilience.

How will you decide your ads are working?
You can choose increase in sales, increase in inquires, downloads of sales material, registrations, or simply website visits.
If your success is selling a pair of shoes, you want to find in Google (or elsewhere) a count of how many sales you made from your ads.
If you are only looking to increase visits to your site, you can see that in Google.
If you want to measure sales, downloads or similar, you may need to have an IT person set up what is called "conversion tracking."
Conversion tracking is not hard for someone to set up, but may take a while to find someone to do it.
You want to pull out a number that web people call Cost Per Action, or CPA.
That simply means how much you pay Google for each of your successes.
For example, if you are selling shoes, and you spend $20 to Google for every shoe sale, you have a CPA of $20.
That may be good or may be bad; but you will have a firm number.
You may want to increase your advertising if you are happy, or rethink your ads, keywords or budget if you are unhappy.
Apply a small amount of the cleaner using a clean, soft cloth.
Apply the Coach Leather Moisturizer to restore luster and shine to the newly cleaned leather.
Wear underwear that hugs your body.
Pick what makes you comfortable.
Do n't forget the coverup.
Clean your guinea pig's cage at least once every week.
Spot - clean your guinea pig's cage daily.
Use odor control bedding.
Develop your interests.
Be respectful of others.
Pick mature friends.
Use good manners when you interact with people.
Observe good online etiquette.
Be helpful.
Avoid trying to be the center of attention all the time.
Accept both compliments and criticism with maturity.
Make a gratitude list once a month.
Give a small gift.
Appreciate nature.
Write thank you cards.
Prepare a bowl of ice - water.
Chill the eggs to stop the cooking process.
Refrigerate the eggs or serve them immediately.
Peel the eggs when you're ready to eat them.
Use a teaspoon to keep the egg white intact while you peel it.
Store eggs in the refrigerator for up to five days.
If you want to stop being selfish, then you have to learn to listen to other people.
And that means you should really listen, not just nod, and say "Uh huh," until it's your turn to speak.
Listening means absorbing what people say, remembering what people say, and understanding the problems of your friends, significant others, and coworkers.
It can also help if you ask open - ended questions that give your conversation partner a chance to express him or herself.
Do n't interrupt.
After your friend talks, give a thoughtful response by referencing points made in the conversation to show that you really paid attention.
If your friend has a problem, do n't instantly compare it to your own problem, which you claim is "way worse."
Take every problem on its own terms and give relevant advice when you can without making it all about you.
You can say something like, "I was in a similar situation, and this is what helped me.
Do you think it might work for you?
"This small and simple gesture could make a big difference in your friendship.
One key aspect of being a good friend is being supportive, which includes supporting your friend's activities from time to time.
The next time you and your friend hang out, let her pick the movie, the dinner place, the happy hour bar, or the activity that you'll do together.
Once you get in the habit of doing this, you may find that you get pleasure out of making the people you care about happy.
You can also take turns.
She can pick what you'll do one week and you can pick what you do the next.
Go to the store, shop for the things that you know your friend will love, and then spend at least an hour cooking a delicious meal and setting the table.
Preparing a meal for your friend takes time, money, and effort, and you'll see how good it feels to do something nice for another person.
This is an especially nice gesture if your friend is tired, broke, or in need of some comfort.
Do n't make your friend bring over anything except something to drink.
You'll be doing all the work that night.
If you find that you really like cooking for others, you can even start baking cookies or making stews and then dropping them off at your friends' houses in the evening.
Stopping to give good, heartfelt, and meaningful advice to a friend can really make you feel more giving and less selfish.
Not all gifts are physical; sometimes the best thing you can do for a friend is help her figure out her problems.
Do n't just tell your friend what she wants to hear; instead, take the time to give her meaningful and actionable advice that can really change her life.
Giving good advice to your friends may also make you more aware of what your friends really need instead of what you need.
This is easier said than done.
Though being selfish and being self - involved are n't exactly the same thing, they do go hand in hand.
So, make a point of talking about yourself only a third of the time when you're with a friend; spend the rest of your time talking about your friend, about other people you know, or about other outside topics.
If your friend brings up a problem and you've experienced a similar thing, it is OK to briefly talk about yourself to say you've gone through something similar as long as the goal of your doing so is to tell your friend that you can readily empathize with her.
After you mention this, quickly turn the spotlight back to her so she can continue talking.
If you do n't normally do this, you should really make a habit of it.
The next time you're with your friends, ask them how they're doing, what they're feeling, how their days went, or what they have coming up that week.
Do n't make it too obvious that you're changing your trajectory and start bombarding them with questions at once; instead, make your way around to asking them questions about themselves and what they have going on.
Showing an interest in others is a great way to be less selfish.
It should n't feel superficial.
You should ask your friends about themselves because they're your friends and because you care.
Do n't do your friend a favor as a calculated ploy for getting something that you want later; do it out of the goodness of your heart.
The favor can be big or small, anything from picking up coffee for your friend when she's stuck in a major study session to taking three hours out of your evening to explain chemical equations to her.
If you see that your friend really needs something but is afraid to ask, you should be the one to suggest it even before your friend does.
And sometimes, you can do your friend a favor even if she really does n't need anything, just because you're feeling nice or saw something that made you think of her.
This method will work for the following purse collections: Hamptons Suede Hamptons Mosaic Soho Suede Chelsea Nubuc Do n't overdo it with the vinegar.
Suede does not react well to too much liquid.
Use a new clean cloth to dab the moist part of the purse.
Let it air dry in a cool dry place.
Avoid the sun or any place that is too hot.
Gently rub the eraser over the stain until it disappears.
If the part that you cleaned now looks flat or lacks texture, apply a small metal brush to the surface in a circular motion to get it back into shape.

If you keep your eggs in the refrigerator, it's important that you do n't try to cook them cold.
Eggs crack because gases heat and expand within the shell.
When the pressure becomes too great, the gases escape by cracking weak points in the porous shell.
Bringing eggs to room temperature before cooking slows down that process.
If you do n't want to wait for the eggs to warm up naturally, try soaking them in hot tap water for a few minutes before cooking.
When an egg is fresh, the the outer membrane sticks to the egg shell while the inner membrane sticks to the albumen (the "white").
As an egg ages, these membranes adhere more closely to the shell itself.
Before you submerge an egg, prick the large end of the shell with a clean thumbtack or safety pin.
This will allow the trapped air bubbles - which are normally responsible for cracking - to escape during the boiling process.
Stack the eggs very gently to avoid cracking.
Do n't overcrowd the pot - you should only boil one layer of eggs at a time, and they should not be pressing against each other.
If you try to boil too many eggs at once, some of them may crack from the weight.
Test whether your eggs are fresh by placing them into a bowl of saltwater.
If the egg sinks to the bottom, it's fresh.
If it floats to the top, there's a good chance that it has gone bad.
Lay a folded cheesecloth inside the bottom of the pot , This helps cushion the eggs so that they are less likely to crack
Fill the pot gently with at least one inch (3 cm) of water.
Pour the water against the side of the pan so that it does not disturb the eggs.
If you can not avoid pouring the water onto the eggs, steady them with your hand so that they do not slide around and crack.
Add half a teaspoon of salt to the water.
This makes the eggs easier to peel, and it may help prevent them from cracking.
Salted water helps to make the egg white firm up more quickly.
It also helps plug small leaks if the shell cracks during the cooking process.
Never drop eggs directly into a pot of hot water, or the shells will crack and the egg will run (giving you poached eggs).
By exposing cold eggs to warm or hot water, you are "shocking" them with a sudden temperature shift, which causes cracks to form.
Furthermore, cold water helps to keep the eggs from overcooking.
Use one teaspoon of vinegar for each egg, and pour it directly into the water before you turn the heat on.
Adding vinegar to the water helps the proteins in the egg white coagulate faster to plug any cracks that develop in the shell.
This is a common problem, especially with eggs that are very cold.
You can also wait to add vinegar when an egg cracks in the water.
You may notice a bit of white fluid seeping from a cracked egg.
Try to be quick here - if you add the vinegar to the water as soon as you notice a crack, the egg should still boil evenly.
If you do n't add the vinegar in time, do n't worry.
The cracked egg should still boil fine, although it may not look perfect.
Let the other person speak.
Show empathy.
Macular degeneration is a common age - related condition.
As you get older, the risk of developing AMD increases.
At least one - third of adults over the age of 75 have some level of AMD.
If one or both of your parents developed macular degeneration, then chances are you might develop the same condition when you hit the 60 - year - old mark.
However, remember that genes are n't everything and how you take care of yourself matters, too.
In general, women and Caucasians are more at risk of developing macular degeneration.
Smokers are at high risk of developing this eye condition.
There have been several studies that have linked smoking to the deterioration of the macula.
Cigarette smoke is linked with damage to the retina.
If you're a smoker (especially if you're female or Caucasian), macular degeneration is something you need to be conscious of, even if the symptoms are n't present.
Knowing your overall health can be a major factor for developing AMD.
Those afflicted with conditions such as high blood pressure and diabetes are at risk.
Even non-diabetics whose diet is comprised of carbohydrates high on the glycemic index tend to develop macular degeneration later on in life.
Remember that one sign of wet macular degeneration is leaking of blood from the retinal vessels.
This will worsen when you have clogged arteries due to plaque deposits.
How frequently are you exposed to fluorescent lighting?
There is concern that the UV radiation from fluorescent lighting may increase your risk of eye disease.
In addition, if you live in an area in which your eyes are often exposed to sunlight, this may also increase your risk.
Knowing how much your gold is worth is great information to have as you begin the process of selling it.
There is an exact formula for calculating the per - gram value of your scrap gold, and the only variable factor in the equation is the current market price of gold.
You can find the current price by searching the Internet or looking it up in your local newspaper.
Gold is valued per troy ounce, with a troy ounce equaling 31.1 grams.
The price of gold fluctuates hourly according to supply and demand, so the price may be very different in the afternoon from the price you saw in the morning.
It is best to use the Internet for updates, which you can even do while standing at the gold buyer's counter by using your cell phone's Internet access capabilities.
For each group of gold, divide the karat by 24, then multiply that number by today's gold price per gram.
For example, if you have 10K gold and the current price of gold is USD$ 1,600 per ounce or USD$ 51.45 per gram ($1,600 / 31.1), then the price of your scrap gold is USD$ 51.45 x .4167 = USD$ 21.44 per gram.
Use the following conversions to value your gold , 10k = 10/24 = .4167 14k = 14/24 = .5833 18k = 18/24 = .750 22k = 22/24 = .9167 The gold still has to go through an assay process to determine the true percentage of gold
For example, 14kt gold assayed is .575%.
When you melt gold you will lose weight due to alloys used in the making process.
Assaying is a process wherein a sample of the gold is taken from the whole to be processed and assessed for purity.
The sample is melted, separated, and weighed to reach a conclusion about its purity.
If you have 10 grams of 10K gold and you calculated the price at USD$ 21.44 per gram, then your scrap gold is worth 10 x USD$ 21.44 = USD$ 214.40.
Some examples: If you have 5 grams of 14K scrap and gold is USD$ 1,600.00 today, then USD$ 1,600 divided by 31.1 would equal USD$ 51.45.
That figure, multiplied by .5833 (14K) comes out to USD$ 30.01 per gram , USD$ 30.01 multiplied by 5 grams equals USD$ 150.05
If you have 15.3 grams of 10K gold scrap, USD$ 1,600 divided by 31.1 equals USD$ 51.45, and that amount multiplied by .4167 (10K) equals USD$ 21.44 per gram , USD$ 21.44 multiplied by 15.3 grams equals USD$ 328.02
Most people use grams for these calculations but some gold buyers use pennyweight (DWT) instead of grams.
There are 20 pennyweights in a troy ounce.
You can substitute 20 for 31.1 to calculate pennyweight in our formula.
You can also multiply a pennyweight by 1.555 to get an equivalent gram weight or divide a gram weight by the same 1.555 to get pennyweight.
Apply a consistent, subtle style.
Triple - check for spelling and grammar errors.
If you're struggling with exactly how to say ‘ thank you 'to someone, or what to say in a ‘ thank you' card, try using the who, what and when template.
Start the ‘ thank you 'process by making a list of everyone you need to send a ‘ thank you' card to.
For example, if it was your birthday and you received several gifts, write a list of everyone you received a gift from (and what they gave you).
This list should also include the names of anyone who helped you plan an event (e.g. birthday party).
There are six basic parts to any personal ‘ thank you 'note - the greeting, the expression of thanks, the details, the next time, the restatement, and the regards.
The Greeting is simple.
Start the ‘ thank you 'note with the names of the people you are thanking.
If it's a formal ‘ thank you 'note, greet them formally (e.g. Dear Mr. Smith), if it's family or a close friend, greet them informally (e.g. Hey Mom).
The Expression of Thanks is where you thank whomever for whatever they did.
But you can be more creative if you wish (e.g. , It made my day when I opened my birthday gift from you)
The Details is where you get specific.
Adding specific details about why you're thanking the person makes the note much more sincere and personal.
You might want to mention the specific gift you received, or what you spent gift money on, etc. , The Next Time is where you mention something about the next time you'll see or speak to this person
For example, if you're sending a ‘ thank you 'note to your grandparents and you're going to see them shortly at Christmas, mention that.
The Restatement is where you wrap up your ‘ thank you 'note with another message of thanks.
You can write another sentence (e.g. Thank you again for your generosity, I'm so very much looking forward to college and this money is going to help significantly) or you can simply say ‘ thank you 'one more time.
The Regards is similar to the greeting except this time you're signing your name.
Depending on who the thanks is for you may want to be more formal (e.g. Sincerely) or less formal (e.g. With love).
You should send most ‘ thank you 'cards and notes within a month of the event, but sending them sooner is definitely better.
If you fall behind you can always start your ‘ thank you 'note with an apology for taking longer than anticipated.
If you're sending 'thank you' cards for a large event with lots of attendees, plan to spend a certain amount of time every day writing 'thank you' notes until they're all done.
Here's how to clean your purse without taking an extra trip to the coach store: Find the soiled area.
Gently dab the area without scrubbing it , this will keep the texture of the purse intact
Remove excess cleaner by wiping it away gently with a clean, dampened cloth.
Blot the fabric dry with a third clean, white cloth and allow the fabric to dry completely.
If you're trying to remove a grease stain and it does not come out with soap and water, add a drop or two of dish detergent.
Once you've dabbed the stain as well as you could, it's time to let the purse rest.
Give it at least one hour depending on how wet it is.
Do n't use it if the fabric is still wet because this can do further damage.
Now that you've cleaned your purse, it's important to keep it clean in the future.
Here's what to do: Keep a package of baby wipes or a small piece of cloth in your purse.
When you notice a new stain, apply the wipes to the stain, or moisten the piece of cloth and do the same.
Connect a device to the network.
Test your connection.
Use Cognitive - Behavioral Therapy (CBT).

When your macular degeneration is detected early enough, you can exponentially delay the loss of vision.
Starting at the age of 40, regular eye examination should be done at least every six months or according to your ophthalmologist's advice.
You should expect the eye doctor to do a few different types of eye exams to look for drusen, vessel damage, pigment changes in the retina or visual disturbances.
Some examples of exams to detect visual disturbances are as follows: Visual acuity test: This tests your vision at a distance using a chart.
Amsler grid: This checks for central vision disturbances by allowing the patient to dictate whether they are viewing straight lines on the grid, or if they appear wavy.
Dilated eye exam: In this exam, pupils are dilated so allow the doctor to see the optic nerve and retina to evaluate for damage.
The doctor will also check the retina for pigment changes.
Pigments in the retina indicate poor light reception.
Fluorescein angiogram: This test will evaluate the arteries in the eye in order to detect leaky vessels.
The doctor will inject a dye into the arm a patient's arm.
Optical coherence tomography: This exam is done after first dilating the eyes.
Then an infrared light is used to image the retina, therefore allowing the examiner to determine damaged areas.
Aside from the many destructive effects of smoking on the entire body, it can also lead to macular degeneration.
Smoking contains tar that can stimulate the formation of drusen (waste deposits on the eye).
In addition to this, smoking contains caffeine which is a known stimulant that can increase blood pressure.
The blood vessels beneath the retina and macula can easily burst when blood pressure is high.
Smoking can double your chances of having macular degenerative disease, compared to those who do n't smoke.
It's bad for you, your eyes, your organs, and even those around you.
Even if you stop smoking, it may take a few years before the effects will wear off.
Consider that an invitation to start the journey of quitting sooner rather than later.
Take your medication, attend your scheduled exams and make lifestyle changes to adapt to this.
If you are suffering from hypertension and are diagnosed with wet macular degeneration, for example, the already damaged vessels in your eye have trouble compensating with an elevated blood pressure.
This can lead to an increased potential for bursting vessels, thereby causing more leakage.
Exercise has a multitude of health benefits, and that includes benefits for your eyes.
Drusen formation is related to high levels of cholesterol and fat.
Exercise can burn fat and eliminate bad cholesterol, preventing this waste buildup.
It is advisable to exercise at least three times a week.
Make sure you concentrate on aerobics exercises that can make you sweat and burn fat.
The eyes are constantly exposed to harsh ultraviolet (UV) light from the sun and pollutants from smog.
The continuous exposure of the eyes to these elements can lead to oxidative damage.
The oxidation of the cells in the eyes can lead to macular degeneration and other eye diseases.
As a way to counteract this process, you need to eat foods rich in antioxidants.
The most common antioxidants that can help you are Vitamin C, vitamin E, zinc, lutein, and copper.
Vitamin C: The recommended daily dose of vitamin C is 500 milligrams.
Some good sources of vitamin C are: broccoli, cantaloupe, cauliflower, guava, bell peppers, grapes, oranges, berries, lychees, and squash.
Vitamin E: The recommended daily dose of vitamin E is 400 milligrams.
Some good sources of vitamin E are: almonds, sunflower seeds, wheat germ, spinach, peanut butter, collard greens, avocados, mango, hazelnuts, and Swiss chard.
Zinc: The recommended daily dose of zinc is 25 milligrams.
Some good sources of zinc are: lean beef, skinless chicken, lean lamb, pumpkin seeds, yogurt, soybeans, peanuts, starchy beans, sunflower butter, pecans, lutein, kale, spinach, beet greens, lettuce, asparagus, okra, artichokes, watercress, persimmons, and green peas.
Copper, lutein and zeaxanthin: Both lutein and zeaxanthin are naturally found in the retina and lens.
They work as natural antioxidants, aiding in absorption of harsh light and UV rays.
Both can be found in leafy green vegetables.
Get two milligrams of copper daily.
Get 10 milligrams of lutein daily.
Get two milligrams of zeaxanthin daily.
According to research, beta carotene can increase the risk of lung cancer, especially if the patient is concurrently smoking.
Research also shows that beta carotene has no effect on reducing the stage advancement of AMD.
Now, doctors typically recommend a list of supplements that omits beta carotene.
Over-exposure to UV light from the sun can damage the eyes and may contribute to the development of macular degeneration.
Use sunglasses certified with blue light and UV protection for best results.
Some activities that may seem like everyday tasks should now be approached with care.
Depending on the severity of your vision, some tasks may require the help of a caregiver, friend or family member.
It is better to ask for help in these situations, rather than deal with potentially harmful consequences.
Be careful when engaging in these activities: Driving; Riding a bike; Operating heavy machinery. As an AMD patient, it may seem as though your life is suddenly out of your control.
However, as a patient, there are several things that you can do along with the care of your eye care professional to help regulate your situation.
Getting informed is the best way to fully understand the disease as well as adhere to the treatment regimen.
Start by learning about AMD, treatment options, and new technology aimed to help rehabilitation.
If you want to make the stain easier to remove in the future, do what you can to make sure it does n't set.
As soon as you notice a stain forming, treat it.
Do n't put the shirt in a dryer if you notice the stain has n't been removed as much as possible.
In general, do whatever you can to treat the stains before they become too dark.
The collar stain is the result of grease and sweat mixing together in a bad way, so one way to prevent the stains from forming is to make some adjustments to your hygiene routine.
Shower more often, use roll - on antiperspirant on your neck, or use baby powder on your neck to help absorb the grease and sweat.
Some shampoos may mix badly with your unique body chemistry.
If nothing you do seems to help prevent the stains, try switching to a different brand and style of shampoo.
Lean towards using white shirts, instead of colored shirts.
The stains may be more noticeable more quickly, but they're easier to treat.
It is possible to purchase sweat strips, which are stickers that go on your collar to help prevent stains.
You can make your own too, if you're crafty or know someone who is.
Add a snap - in, button - in, or Velcro strip to the collars of the worst offenders.
These can be removed and washed as needed.

Run a clean wash cloth through the water until it is wet.
The cloth should be wet, but not dripping.
Squeeze it until excess moisture has been removed.
Hold the washcloth against the pimple for a few minutes , Allow the wash cloth to cool down
This will bring the pus towards the surface of the pimple, preparing it to be popped.
Move your finger slightly, sliding the washcloth against the pimple.
With the head loosened up, this should be sufficient to pick it up, without causing damage to the surrounding skin.
This method might seem slow and arduous, but it does less damage to the skin than squeezing the pimple directly.
If the whitehead does not fall off the first time that you try this, do it again.
The warmth and moisture should eventually be enough to loosen the whitehead without causing damage to your skin.

There are a variety of factors that will determine which router is best for you.
These include distance, interference, transfer speed, and security.
One of the most important factors to consider when purchasing a router is the distance between the router and the devices that you are wirelessly connecting.
More expensive routers generally have more antennae, which can lead to a more stable connection at further distances.
Another factor to consider is the amount of signal interference.
If you have multiple devices that operate on the 2.4 GHz band, such as microwaves and cordless phones, these can interfere with the Wi - Fi signal.
Newer routers can operate on the 5 GHz band, which is much less crowded and thus less prone to interference.
The drawback is that 5 GHz signals do not travel as far as 2.4 GHz signals.
Transfer speed is a feature to consider.
Newer routers claim to be able to transfer data up to 450 Mbps.
While this may be helpful when moving data between two computers over a network, it will not increase your general Internet speed, as this is set by your ISP.
There are three main router speeds available: 802.11 g (54 Mbps) 802.11 n (300 Mbps), and 802.11 ac (450 Mbps).
It is important to note that these speeds are virtually impossible to attain in any environment other than a clean room free of signal interference.
Finally, make sure that the router you are purchasing has the latest form of wireless encryption, WPA2.
This is pretty much standard in all new routers, but is something to consider if purchasing an older, second - hand router.
Older encryption algorithms are much less secure; a WEP key can be cracked in just a few minutes.
Once you've purchased your router, you will need to connect it to your modem.
The router will have a port in the back labeled WAN / WLAN / Internet.
Connect this port to the modem using a standard Ethernet cable.
Make sure that the router is properly powered and turned on.
This step is not always necessary, but can be very useful if you want to set up the wireless router before connecting any wireless devices to it.
Connecting a computer through a physical cable will allow you to tinker with the wireless settings without losing your connection to the router.
For optimum efficiency while setting up the router, plug it in next to your computer while you adjust the settings.
After you are finished configuring the router, you can move it to where it will normally stay.

These pimples are easy to pop, and when treated with care they can be safely removed without spreading the infection or causing scarring.
Pimples that have just appeared in the past day or two are n't ready to pop yet.
Wait until the whitehead appears at the tip of the blemish.
This could worsen your pimple by sending bacteria deeper into your skin.
Popping a pimple this big will almost definitely lead to a scar.
Only a pimple with white pus is ready to pop.
Dermatologists can determine the best way to treat your acne.
They can prescribe creams that will eliminate your pimples.
There are also several procedures they can perform that can treat severe breakouts.
The most commonly prescribed dermatologist treatment is a topical cream, rubbed on the pimples, that will remove oil from the skin and kill acne - causing bacteria.
For red, swollen pimples an oral antibiotic, hormonal birth control, or isotretinoin might be prescribed.
Pimples are caused by sweat sitting on your face.
Anytime you sweat, wash your face gently with lukewarm water to remove dirt and grime.
Do not be harsh or scrub, just wash off sweat.
Scrubbing roughly can worsen acne.
They are easy to digest and high in potassium, which is depleted by vomiting and diarrhea.
They are also rich in amylase - resistant starch, which has been shown to end diarrhea more quickly.
Some find ripe bananas to be easier on the stomach than the under - ripe bananas.
Rice helps to improve the rate of rehydration and decrease the length of illness.
You can prepare rice in several ways: Use a rice cooker.
Bring 1 cup of rice and 2 cups of water to a boil, then cover and reduce heat to a simmer.
Wait until all the water is absorbed, approximately 20 minutes.
Cook rice in boiling water until soft enough to eat, then strain.
Apples are a low fiber food that helps to make your stool firmer.
Raw fruits are difficult to digest, so applesauce is preferred to a whole apple or slices.
To make your own applesauce: Place 6 peeled, cored, and quartered apples in a large pot along with 1 cup of water and 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) of lemon juice.
Bring to a boil, then turn down the heat and simmer for 30 minutes.
Use a potato masher if necessary to break up any chunks.
Stir in 1 teaspoon of sugar.
You can also add 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon, though this may upset your stomach.
If purchasing apple sauce, make sure to buy unsweetened or 'no sugar added' applesauce varieties.
Toast is another easily digested, low fiber food that will help to firm up your stool.
For added nutrition, you should feel free to spread jam on your toast if you can stomach it.
You will probably want to avoid butter and peanut butter, as they are high in fat, which is hard on your stomach.
While whole grain toast is typically healthier than white toast, that is not as important here.
The high fiber content in whole grain products can lead to gastric upset.
Bring the water to a gentle boil using a medium heat.
Turn off the heat when the water boils.
Know when it is safe to eat a cracked egg.
A pilsner, IPA or light beer are all good choices.
You can make darker beer green, but it requires so much food coloring that your teeth will turn green.
Use more drops for beer of a darker hue.
Use liquid food coloring, as opposed to gel; it'll mix with the beer much more easily.
Do n't use blue food coloring.
You may think it will mix with yellow beer to make green, but since the colors are n't pure pigments, you'll end up with something closer to turquoise.
The food coloring will mix with the beer as you pour, tinting your beer a lovely green.
Do n't stir the beer, or it's likely to go flat.
The U.S. and Canadian governments do not allow manufacturers to label something 100% organic if that food has been genetically modified or been fed genetically modified feed.
You may find that organic food is more expensive and different in appearance from conventional products.
Trusted Organic Certification institutions include the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Quality Assurance International (QAI), Oregon Tilth, and California Certified Organic Farmers (CCOF).
Look for their mark of approval on the label of the product.
Also, just because something says "organic," it does not mean that it does n't contain GMOs.
In fact, it can still contain up to 30% GMOs, so be sure the label says 100% organic.
Eggs labeled "free - range," "natural," or "cage - free" are not necessarily GMO free; look for eggs that are 100% organic.
Price lookup (PLU) codes can be found on the stickers that are on your produce.
These codes can be used to identify foods have been genetically engineered or modified.
If it is a 4 - digit number, the food is conventionally produced , This food may or may not be genetically modified
If it is a 5 - digit number beginning with an 8, it is GM.
However, do not trust that GE foods will have a PLU identifying it as such, because PLU labeling is optional.
If it is a 5 - digit number beginning with a 9, it is organic and is not genetically modified. Most cattle in the U.S. are grass - fed but spend the last portion of their lives in feedlots in which they may be given GM corn, the purpose of which is to increase intramuscular fat and marbling.
Some meats like pork and chicken can not be 100% grassfed.
In those instances, look for meat that is labeled 100% certified organic.
You should also buy wild caught fish instead of farm raised fish.
Farm raised fish are fed with genetically modified grains.
It was once rare to find products labeled as such, but thanks to organizations such as the Non-GMO Project, they are becoming more common.
You can also research websites that list companies and foods that do not use genetically modified foods, but be aware that some information is often incomplete, and conflicting interests may not be declared.
Although more than half of all GM foods are produced in the U.S., most of it comes from large industrial farms.
By shopping at farmers' markets, signing up for a subscription from a local Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) farm, or patronizing a local co-op, you may be able to avoid GM products and possibly save money at the same time.
Shopping locally may also give you the opportunity to speak to the farmer and find out how he or she feels about GMOs and whether or not they use them in their own operation.
Buying local food does not guarantee that you will be avoiding GMOs.
Many local farmers use genetically modified seeds.
Favor foods that you can cook and prepare yourself, rather than foods that are processed or prepared (e.g., anything that comes in a box or a bag, including fast food).
What you lose in convenience, you may recover in money saved and satisfaction gained, as well as increased peace of mind.
Try cooking a meal from scratch once or twice a week; you may enjoy it and decide to do it more often.
If you grow your own food, you buy seeds that have not been genetically modified.
This way, you know exactly what was grown and what went into growing it.
Practice self - acceptance.
Focus on your strengths.
Trust that it will work out.
Get social support.
CBT exercises teach you to change your habits and patterns of thinking.
You can soon start changing your feelings of regret, shame, and anger.
Instead, you'll focus on emotionally healing any harmful, unproductive thoughts you have.
CBT works to reduce and replace your feelings of regret and anxiety, instead of simply telling yourself to stop thinking about the past.
With regret, people often wonder "why" they acted or did n't act, and this is often where people become stuck.
List your regrets and any questions you keep asking yourself.
For example, you might wonder why you acted the way you did.
Go through your list and change the "why" questions into "what's next?"
This will help you overcome the feeling of being stuck.
In the future you could take a 5 minute break before engaging the children.
Regrets can be important learning tools for the future.
Try to look for the lessons learned and recognize that life lessons make you wiser.
For example, if you regret not treating your spouse with respect, you may have learned that disrespecting your spouse makes you feel terrible.
Having this knowledge makes you a wiser spouse and person.
What you regret may also be things you have learned about yourself and others.
Having this knowledge decreases the chances of making a similar choice in the future.
Make sure to apply the wisdom you've gained.
For example, if you've learned that disrespecting your spouse makes your spouse feel distrustful, do n't do it again in the future.
While you can not change what happened in the past, you can choose how your past affects your present and future.
For example, you ca n't change how much or how often you drank in college, but you can make the choice not to let the regret make you feel guilty now or let it affect your future choices.
Beating yourself up over things beyond your control would be considered unproductive regret.
But, productive regret can be positive if you are moved to improve yourself or act on opportunities.
Once you're aware of a missed opportunity, be it educational, financial, or emotional, you're more likely to correct the mistake in the future.
If you find yourself ambivalent about taking a new opportunity, ask yourself if you'd rather worry about a wasted opportunity or take a chance.
By trying something new, you're minimizing future regrets.

The best thing to do is to give the person time to heal and not to date at all until they are ready.
But if feelings are serious, this is easier said than done.
Though you and your new partner might have initially spent hours dissecting the previous relationship, this is not the time to rehash it.
Though you should n't pretend the person's ex does n't exist, you should avoid talking or asking about them, until the person has had enough space -- this could take months, or even over a year.
Of course, if the person really wants to talk about the past relationship, you should n't change the subject.
But you can say that you think, in order to focus on your new relationship, you should leave the past behind as much as you can until you have firmer footing.
Do n't get stuck in the past, and do n't worry so much about being the perfect person for your new partner - just be yourself.
If you were really meant to be together, then you'll find a routine that works for you and will find a path to true happiness.
Do n't compare yourself to the ex, try to be the opposite of the ex, or try to be something you're not.
Sure, you might have used some devious tactics to make your new relationship happen, but if you want it to last, you should think only about the two of you being together - and nothing else.
Even if you had a deep friendship before, you should find new things for you to do together as a couple that can define you as an item, not make you think of the past.
You may find yourself in a hard position.
Your new love interest has broken up with an ex for you -- who is to say it wo n't happen again if they find a person who is even more right for them than you are?
Well, no one can promise that it wo n't happen, but to stay sane and have an amazing relationship, you have to tell yourself that the previous breakup was meant to be, and that you and the person you're with really belong together.
It wo n't happen again.
If you always ask about what the ex is up to or act jealous when the person spends time with others, you'll be dooming your relationship to failure.
If it's really meant to last, then in the long run, you'll find that you'll stop worrying about the ex or the previous relationship.
But this could take months - or even years , If you're meant to be together forever, burying the past will be worth it

This will give you an opportunity to hear how it sounds.
You can make changes based on what you hear as well as what you read.
Allow a little time to go by after you've written the dialogue to read it, otherwise your brain will fill in what you were going for rather than what is actually on the page.
Have a trusted friend or family member go over your dialogue.
A fresh pair of eyes can tell you whether your dialogue is natural sounding, or needs work.
There is nothing more irritating to a reader (including and especially, publishers and agents) than punctuation that is being abused, especially in dialogue.
There should be a comma after the end of the dialogue and the closing quotation mark.
For example: "Hello , I'm Jane," said Jane
If you add action to the middle of a piece of dialogue, you'll either capitalize the second half of the dialogue, or not.
For example: "I ca n't believe he killed my father," Jane said, her eyes filling with tears.
"It's just not like him. , or" I ca n't believe he killed my father, "Jane said, her eyes filling with tears," since it's just not like him. , If there's no said, only an action, then there's a period in place of a comma in the closing quotation mark
When people talk, they are not overly verbose.
They say things in short, simple ways and you'll want to reflect that in your dialogue.
For example, instead of "I can not believe that after all these many years, it was Uncle Red that put the poison in my father's evening cocktail and murdered him," said Jane, you might say "I ca n't believe Uncle Red poisoned my father! , Each character should have her own sound and voice, but too much of an accent or a drawl will become annoying or even offensive to readers
Also, using a dialect you are n't familiar with can end up employing stereotypes and being incredibly offensive to the natural speakers of the dialect.
Establish where characters come from in other ways.
For example, use regional terms such as "soda" versus "pop" to establish geography.
Laughing alleviates a stressful situation, releases endorphins to invigorate your mind and body, and improves your immune system.

People all over the world are being trained to practice laughter yoga to heal the mind, body, and spirit.
Studies have shown that putting feelings into words helps you deal with your emotions, halting these negative feelings.
Putting your thoughts on paper can provide an emotional release and makes our emotional pain less intense.
Keep a private journal, write letters that you never send, or blog about the tough times.
Stay in touch with family and friends who will be there for you during the tough times.
Because it often takes bravery to admit you have a problem, part of being resilient is being able to ask for and accept help.
Commit to social activities as a way of keeping connected.
Find a meet - up or schedule a regular crochet chat with your friends, for example.
Science has shown that certain foods can affect your brain and your mood.
From chocolate to the Omega - 3 fatty acids found in fish, your diet affects your health, so be sure to eat right in preparation of facing life's challenges.
One of the most widely recommended dietary plans to follow is the DASH diet.
The DASH diet, named for Dietary Approaches to Stopping Hypertension, aims to control salt and keep blood pressure at a healthy level, especially important because hypertension (or high blood pressure) has been called ‘ the silent killer. '
By keeping your blood pressure under control naturally, you will be in a healthy state to deal with life's struggles.
Staying active can reduce anxiety, stress, and irritable feelings.
Doctors recommend getting at least 30 minutes of heart - pumping exercise a day, but you can even break that amount up into 10 minutes segments.
Have a quick jog, climb some stairs, play a quick game of tennis, or go for a bike ride with the kids.
Your heart and your mood will thank you.
You're not the only one feeling regretful about something.
Consider what others may be going through.
This may require you to challenge your own prejudices and truly listen to others.
For example, if you regret heavy drinking during your years in college, you may have a deep understanding of how you son feels after a night he's not proud of.
You may think about regret in terms of the following statements: "I should have...." "I could have...." "I ca n't believe I...." "Why did n't I....." Change these statements into statements of gratitude.
You'll think about the past differently and start to lose the regret.
When you catch yourself thinking a regretful statement, change it to a statement of gratitude.
This can help you start thinking about the past in a positive light.
For example, change "I should have gone to college," to "I am grateful it's not too late to go to college."
Or change "I could have tried harder to stop drinking," to "I am grateful that I can try to do better now."
Regret can cause resentment towards yourself and others.
Not only will this reduce your feelings of regret, but it can improve your self - esteem.
Healthy self - esteem is critical to many areas of your life, including relationships.
Do n't simply try to remove the regret.
Instead, own up to your mistakes and feelings, but allow yourself to move on.
The exercise of writing a letter will help you practice forgiving yourself.
This emotional and cognitive tool will start to healing your feelings of regret.
Write a letter addressed to your younger or past - self and in the letter talk to your younger - self like you might talk to your child or close friend.
An affirmation is a positive statement to encourage, uplift you, and make you more compassionate towards yourself.
Having compassion for yourself makes it easier to empathize and forgive your past - self, which can reduce feelings of regret.
Tell yourself, write, or think the affirmations.
Some examples of affirmations include: I am a good person and deserve the best despite my past.
I am human and make mistakes, and that is ok.
I have learned a lot from my past, and I am worthy of a bright future.
In most schools, students work on arithmetic during the elementary grades.
Arithmetic includes the fundamentals of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.
Work on drills.
Doing a lot of arithmetic problems again and again is the best way to get the fundamentals down pat.
Look for software that will give you lots of different math problems to work on.
Also, look for timed drills to increase your speed.
Repetition is the basis of math.
The concept has to be not only learned, but put to work for you to remember it!
You can also find arithmetic drills online, and you can download arithmetic apps onto your mobile device.
This course will provide the building blocks that you'll need to solve algebra problems later on.
Learn about fractions and decimals.
You'll learn to add, subtract, multiply and divide both fractions and decimals.
Regarding fractions, you'll learn how to reduce fractions and interpret mixed numbers.
Regarding decimals, you'll understand place value, and you'll be able to use decimals in word problems.
Study ratios, proportions and percentages.
These concepts will help you to learn about making comparisons.
Solve squares and square roots.
When you've mastered this topic, you'll have perfect squares of many numbers memorized.
You'll also be able to work with equations containing square roots.
Introduce yourself to basic geometry.
You'll learn all of the shapes as well as 3D concepts.
You'll also learn concepts like area, perimeter, volume and surface area, as well as information about parallel and perpendicular lines and angles.
Understand some basic statistics.
In pre-algebra, your introduction to statistics mostly includes visuals like graphs, scatter plots, stem - and - leaf plots and histograms.
Learn algebra basics.
These will include concepts like solving simple equations containing variables, learning about properties like the distributive property, graphing simple equations and solving inequalities.
In your first year of algebra, you will learn about the basic symbols involved in algebra.
You'll also learn to: Solve linear equations and inequalities that contain 1 - 2 variables.
You'll learn how to solve these problems not only on paper, but sometimes on a calculator as well.
Tackle word problems.
You'll be surprised how many everyday problems that you'll face in your future involve the ability to solve algebraic word problems.
For example, you'll use algebra to figure out the interest rate that you earn on your bank account or on your investments.
You can also use algebra to figure out how long you'll have to travel based on the speed of your car.
Work with exponents.
When you start solving equations with polynomials (expressions containing both numbers and variables), you'll have to understand how to use exponents.
This may also include working with scientific notation.
Once you have exponents down, you can learn to add, subtract, multiply and divide polynomial expressions.
Understand functions and graphs.
In algebra, you'll really get into graphic equations.
You'll learn how to calculate the slope of a line, how to put equations into point - slope form, and how to calculate the x - and y - intercepts of a line using slope - intercept form.
Figure out systems of equations.
Sometimes, you're given 2 separate equations with both x and y variables, and you have to solve for x or y for both equations.
Fortunately, you'll learn many tricks for solving these equation including graphing, substitution and addition.
In geometry, you'll learn about the properties of lines, segments, angles and shapes.
You'll memorize a number of theorems and corollaries that will help you to understand the rules of geometry.
You'll learn how to calculate the area of a circle, how to use the Pythagorean theorem and how to figure out relationships between angles and sides of special triangles.
You'll see a lot of geometry on future standardized tests like the SAT, the ACT and the GRE.
Algebra II builds on the concepts that you learned in Algebra I but adds more complex topics involving more complex non-linear functions and matrices.
You know the words of trig: sine, cosine, tangent, etc..
Trigonometry will teach you many practical ways to calculate angles and lengths of lines, and these skills will be invaluable for people who go into construction, architecture, engineering or surveying.
Calculus may sound intimidating, but it's an amazing tool chest for understanding both the behavior of numbers and the world around you.
Calculus will teach you about functions and about limits.
You'll see the behavior or a number of useful functions including e ^ x and logarithmic functions.
You'll also learn how to calculate and work with derivatives.
A first derivative gives you information based on the slope of a tangent line to an equation.
For instance, a derivative tells you the rate at which something is changing in a non-linear situation.
A second derivative will tell you whether a function is increasing or decreasing along a certain interval so that you can determine the concavity of a function.
Integrals will teach you how to calculate the area beneath a curve as well as volume.
High school calculus usually ends with sequences and series.
Although students wo n't see many applications for series, they are important to people who go on to study differential equations.
Calculus is still only the beginning for some.
If you are considering a career with a high involvement of math and science, like an engineer, try going a bit farther!
Regret is a critical way of thinking or feeling in which you blame yourself for things that happened.
Productive regret can help you learn to change your behavior for the future.
Unproductive regret, where you completely blame yourself, can create chronic stress which leads to health problems.
Regret can be over things you have done or not done.
For example, you could regret acting a certain way during an argument, or you may regret not taking a job offer.
These may be different from person to person, but feelings of regret include: sadness, loss, remorse, anger, shame, and anxiety.
Identify these feelings related to regret.
For example, you may have the thought of a past deed and then you think about this event for the majority of the day.
This can leave you feeling defeated and hopeless.
You may think about what you did or said, or you may think about what you wished you had done differently to change your current situation.
Constant rethinking and regretting can cause anxiety.
This may lead to worrying about future decisions that you might regret later.
Think about what's causing your regret.
People can feel regretful for a number of reasons.
Typical regretful experiences include: Lifestyle: Many people regret moving to a different country or may wish they had n't turned off a house offer.
For example, you moved from Canada to Australia because you wanted a warmer life.
But just months later, you have found it impossible to find work, have experienced life on the streets and feel homesick every single day.
You wish you had n't made the move down under.
Work: People may regret not following a different career path and pursuing their dream jobs.
For example, you dread going into your office job everyday and frequently wish you had not turned down the opportunity to be a co-owner in your own business.
Family: People may regret not settling disputes with a family member or friend, especially if the other person passed.
Or they may regret not spending more time with older family members.
For example, you moved across the country for your spouse's job.
You never made enough effort to stay connected to your grandmother through calls or visits.
Now that your grandmother has passed, you regret not putting more effort into staying connected.
Children: People may regret starting a family.
For example, you started a family because you wanted to make your spouse's dream come true , 1 year later, you are getting no enjoyment from parenthood and your relationship with your partner has suffered for it, you wish daily you had become a dog foster like you wanted to
Keep in mind however that many Mom and Dads experience postpartum depression following the birth of a baby, get professional help if you think you might have this.
Marriage: People may regret the timing of their marriage or their choice of partner.
Some may even regret getting married at all.
For example, you married your husband / wife because your family liked and approved of them.
After 5 years of marriage, you have found that you share no interests.
You often think about what your life would have been like if you had married your long - time girl / boyfriend who your parents did not like.
Part of being poised is maintaining your composure in difficult or irritating situations.
Instead of reacting automatically in a negative way such as storming out of the room or yelling at someone, maintain your poise by stopping and take a breath or removing yourself from the situation in an elegant way (i.e. excusing yourself to go to the restroom).
If you are alone, you can try a deep breathing exercise to calm yourself down.
Breathe in through your nose deeply and out through your mouth slowly.
Focus on your breathing and your experience of it.
Your body should begin to relax and once you feel calm you can stop the breathing exercise.
Being mindful of what you are reacting to is an important component of keeping your composure.
If you observe what is happening, you can begin to change how you react to the situation and be more poised.
Ask yourself, "What am I reacting to?
What am I thinking and feeling about this situation?
Is this something that is a pattern from my past?
Am I upset about this situation or does it remind me of something else that happened and struck a chord with me? ", Look at the bigger picture
Observe the situation from afar as if you were in a helicopter viewing it from the sky.
What is the bigger picture?
Will this situation matter in 1 month, 6 months, or a year?
You may find that you react to situations that do not affect your life in the long - term.
Having a plan on how to deal with difficult emotions is one surefire way to maintain your composure in difficult situations.
Identify ways to cope with difficult emotions that work for you.
For example, if you notice that you tend to get angry when people do not agree with you on a topic, you may develop specific coping mechanisms for dealing with this situation.
This might include taking deep breaths, counting to ten, or reminding yourself that others can have different opinions and it does n't mean that they think you are dumb or do n't like you.
Do n't be a bully.
Avoid gossip, rumors, and talking about others behind their backs.
Be the bigger person if someone is unkind to you.
Accept personal responsibility.

Adding 1 to a number takes you to the next highest number on the number line.
For example, 2 + 1 = 3.
Any number added to zero equals the same number because "zero" is the same as "nothing."
Doubles are problems that involve adding two of the same number.
For example, 3 + 3 = 6 is an example of an equation involving doubles.
In the example below, you learn through mapping what happens when you add 3 to 5, 2 and 1.
Try the "add 2" problems on your own.
Learn to add 3 numbers together to get a number larger than 10.
Learn about regrouping 1s into the 10s place, 10s into the 100s place, etc..
Add the numbers in the right column first , 8 + 4 = 12, which means you have 1 10 and 2 1s
Write down the 2 under the 1s column.

If you have self - confidence, then you will have poise; the two dovetail.
Accepting yourself increases your self - esteem and can help you develop confidence and poise.
Make a list of your strengths and things you want to improve, including personality characteristics and appearance.
Go down the list and verbally accept each part of yourself.
Say, "I accept that I am talkative.
I accept that I sometimes have a temper. ", In general, you can use a self - affirmation such as saying to yourself," I accept everything about myself
I accept who I am, what I look like, my past, present, and future. ", How you think about yourself affects your actions and your ability to be poised
To develop self - confidence, learn to believe in yourself.
This means believing that you are a positive person who has interesting things to share.
This also means doing things that make you feel confident about yourself.
Visualization is a helpful way to believe in yourself.
Close your eyes and imagine yourself as completely confident and poised.
Where are you?
What does it feel like?
What are you thinking about?
What are you doing?
Think positive thoughts about yourself.
If you find yourself worrying or thinking negatively, re-frame the situation.
You could practice by purposefully thinking, "I can do this.
I can accomplish anything I put my mind to.
I believe in myself , "Try power poses
Our body language can actually shape how we feel about ourselves.
Power poses generally involve making your body bigger (taking up more space) instead of smaller (which indicates a lack of confidence).
Try spreading your legs slightly apart and putting your hands on your hips.
You can find more power poses online.
Paying attention to the positive aspects of yourself can heighten your ability to have confidence and poise in social situations, which can increase the likelihood that you are accepted by others.
Make a list of your accomplishments.
Did you get an A on a paper?
Are you great at swimming and you once won a medal?
Think about how you can use your strengths to increase your poise.
Whatever the situation you are in, the way you think about it can influence the outcome (for better or worse).
Those who believe that something negative will happen may actually influence that outcome to occur.
For example, if you are worried that you will say something silly or wrong in a meeting, this thought can increase your nervousness, which may cause you to stumble over your words.
Thus, you create the outcome that you are fearful of.
Instead of thinking about what might happen or the worst case scenario, focus instead on what you actually want to happen.
Instead of thinking, "Oh no, I hope I do n't stumble over my words," consciously think positive thoughts such as, "I want to speak clearly and effectively.
I will focus on being poised and feeling confident.
I can do this.
"These positive thoughts are much more likely to reduce negative feelings and increase the likelihood of a positive outcome.
Supportive relationships can help to empower you and increase your overall self - confidence.
Through others, we can develop a sense of connection, belonging, and acceptance.
If you are feeling low or not confident in yourself, talk to a friend or family member about it.
Chances are, they will help you identify the good things about you and turn your mood and thoughts around.
This can be very validating and can increase your self - confidence if you know that others support and believe in you , Take a look at your relationships and ask yourself if those who you spend time with are supportive of you
Our social connections should bring us positivity and lift us up in times of stress.
If people are putting you down or making you feel worse about yourself, these connection are not likely to help you become more confident.
Consider distancing yourself from damaging relationships and focus on connecting with supportive individuals.
Brace yourself for the sadness of a lost friendship.
Prepare your defenses for incoming passive - aggression.
Accept the friends who do n't take your side.
Do n't respond with anger.
Maintain emotional distance.
Speak calmly and slowly.
Use non-threatening body language.
Do n't provoke the angry person.
Place one clean fingertip on either side, just below the tip of the whitehead.
You should be able to feel the sebum - filled area easily.
After you've located the sebum - filled area, very gently wiggle your fingers together to coax the fluid out.
If no pus comes out, position your fingertips in a slightly different place around the pimple, then try again.
If the pus still remains in the pimple, stop trying to pop it.
This will encourage the remaining pus to come out; keep doing it until the pimple is completely drained.
Do n't touch the pimple itself, except to blot away the pus with tissues.
There may be some bleeding.
If you see blood, stop pushing at the pimple, and leave it alone - it will only put more pressure on the swollen area, and may cause scarring.
Also, consider applying a small amount of bacitracin ointment to protect it.
When you're trying on swimsuits, you need to keep your underwear on , However, you also need to make sure the suit fits properly
Therefore, make sure your underwear does n't bunch, and pick something on the slimmer side to wear to the store.
Many websites will tell you to pick swimsuit style that's flattering to your body type, but the truth is, you can find a suit that's flattering in any style.
The important thing is that you feel comfortable and that you like the suit.
For instance, you may not think you can get away with a two - piece because of your curves.
If you do n't feel comfortable showing as much skin, you could wear a tankini, which is basically a tank top with a bikini bottom, or a high - waisted bikini.
Pick a fun pattern and rock that suit.
For men, you also need to decide what you want out of your suit, such as how much skin you want to show.
You could go for anything from full - length trunk shorts to swim briefs.
You do n't literally need to jump, but you should move around as much as possible once you get the suit on.
You want to make sure it stays on in all the right places because you'll certainly be moving a lot in the water.
Try walking up and down outside the dressing room or doing a few jumping jacks in the suit to see how it wears.
Make sure it does n't move around.
A coverup is just something you can slip on over your swimsuit to go from the beach to the car or to hang out on the beach in while you're not swimming.
For men, it can be something as simple as a t - shirt.
For women, it can be anything from a pair of shorts and a top to a breezy, cottony dress made for going over swimwear or a sarong.

As a business owner, the most important goal when beginning a new business, job, or craft is simply to survive.
If you're starting your own business or getting in on the ground floor, avoid establishing unrealistic goals for the fledgling enterprise.
The heart of all businesses, even those with altruistic, selfless ownership, is making money.
The goal might be modest (just enough to allow your business to survive and grow) or enormous (to attract additional investors and satisfy shareholders), but this is true to some degree for every business.
You will never achieve that goal of, say, providing mittens to all of the underprivileged kids in the world through your new mitten shop, if you do n't focus on keeping that coffee shop in business and thriving first.
Long - term goals are important, but should n't come at the expense of sustainable short - term ones.
Those expenses might be the salaries of particularly accomplished professionals you're hoping to woo, or trade magazines, or simply a nice suit so as to look the part in the company of your colleagues and clients.
Aim to invest in future success, not just celebrate current success.
Avoid exorbitantly expensive ties and jackets, company cars, and huge offices you really do n't need - but do n't take it for granted that nice things are automatically exorbitant.
Image is an important component of success in business, but not just when it comes to the superficial.
Having an enormous office you ca n't fill or work you ca n't pay for punctually (on account of that enormous office or company car lease) will feed into other companies' perception of you as well.
New businesses need to survive if they're going to ever be anything, but all businesses must take on risk of some kind.
Stepping outside the norm, either in your role at a company or in the expectations for the industry, is necessary for success in a crowded field.
Plan your ventures carefully and hedge as much risk as you can, but be prepared for the occasional setback.
Successful innovators are held in high esteem in the American consciousness, but actually pursuing unproven ideas can be terrifying.
Do n't be afraid of venturing into the unknown - great ideas may be a dime a dozen, but putting in the work to pursue a great idea shows spirit and tenacity.
An idea's failure is n't always indicative of having the wrong idea - sometimes it's simply the right idea, pursued ineffectively.
Do n't scrap everything you've been trying all at once and or totally restructure.
When working within a company or partnership, for example, the issue could be solved by better understanding each member's accountability.
Failure illuminates some truth about your methods and goals, however much it may sting.
Interpret your failures not as shameful, but as a reason to reflect on your work.
Sometimes it's only through facing the insurmountable, failing, and then struggling to pull ourselves back together that we develop the tenacity our work requires of us. "
Failure, "as Henry Ford put it," is simply the opportunity to begin again, this time more intelligently. "
Use a match or lighter to heat up and sterilize the pin.
Expose every bit of the pin to fire for several seconds to kill off any bacteria.
Give the pin at least a minute to cool down.
It should not be painfully hot when you use it to pop your pimple.
Apply rubbing alcohol to the pin, to your hands, and to the zit.
Be sure that everything involved in the procedure is sanitized with rubbing alcohol.
You do not want to point the pin toward your face.
Instead, you should hold it along your face, so that when you poke your pimple it wo n't penetrate anything but the very tip of the pimple.
Do not touch anything but the white part of the zit.
Penetrating the red part of the pimple will cause scarring.
Instead, run the pin through the very tip of the pimple, so that it goes through one end and out the other.
The pin should have penetrated the length of the white tip.
Pull the pin out, away from your face, so that it ruptures the white tip when you remove the pin from the pimple.
Consider squeezing with a cotton swab to avoid doing additional damage to the skin.
Use a cotton swab to rub the area down with alcohol and clean up bacteria.

Not every router comes with software to install, but if yours did, then install it on a computer that is connected to the router via an Ethernet cable.
Using the bundled software makes setting up a router much more convenient than going in to the configuration menus.
Using the software, designate the name of your wireless network, and the type of security that you want to use.
Choose WPA2 for the most secure network.
Choose a password and continue.
Most router software will automatically detect your internet settings.
This is the information that the router needs to translate your internet connection and transfer it to all of your wirelessly connected devices.
If your router did not come with any installation software, you will need to connect to the router's configuration page through your web browser.
Open your browser of choice and enter the web address for the router.
This is typically 192.168.1.1 or 192.168.0.1.
Consult the documentation that came with the router to find the exact address.
You will be asked for a username and password to continue into the router configuration.
These are also provided in the documentation that came with your router.
Typical defaults are username: admin and Password: password or admin.
You can search for your router model's specific login information at PortFoward.com , This includes the IP address and DNS information from your internet service provider
Most routers will fill this section in automatically.
If it does not, contact your ISP for the information that you need to enter.
Most routers will have a Wireless Settings section towards the top of the router's menu.
From this section you can enable or disable the wireless signal, change the network name, and set the encryption.
To set the name of the network, select the SSID field.
This is the name that will be displayed on any device that detects your network.
If you are living in an area with a lot of public traffic, avoid putting any identifiable information in the SSID, as anyone with a wireless device can see it.
Make sure to set the encryption to the latest version allowed by your router.
In most cases, this will be WPA2.
WPA2 operates with a single password.
You can enter whatever you'd like, but a strong password is recommended.
Stronger passwords contain upper and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
Make sure you click the Apply or Save Changes button in your router's configuration when you are done changing the settings.
The router will process for a moment, and your new settings will take effect.
In order to get the best possible signal, try to place your router in a central location.
Keep in mind that any obstacles such as walls and doors will degrade the signal.
If you have multiple floors, you may want to consider multiple routers to ensure that you have the coverage you need.
Remember that it must be physically connected to your modem, so this may limit your options when placing the router.

Get a good view of the watch face and where the hour and minute hands are pointing.
For this method, use an analog watch with an hour and minute hand.
A digital watch wo n't work.
In the Northern Hemisphere, the sun points toward the south.
Line up your watch's hour hand with the sun as the first step to discovering the north - south line.
In the Northern Hemisphere, this halfway point marks the north - south line.
True north is the side pointing away from the sun.
Some analog watches have an adjustable rim for direction finding.
If your watch has this, you can adjust it so an arrow sits at this halfway point.
Note that this method is n't perfect because time zones throughout the world are not always consistent.
You may not be able to locate the precise point of true north, but it will give you its general location.
Then find the halfway mark between the hour hand and the 12 o'clock point to locate the north - south line.
In the Southern Hemisphere, true north is the side pointing towards the sun.
Depending on the time of year and area of the world, Daylight Savings time could be in effect.
The method works the same, but use since there is a 1 - hour time difference, use 1 o'clock instead of 12.
Remember that Daylight Savings is between March and November in participating areas.

Anger is a powerful emotion, but it can be tamed.
Do n't overreact to minor things that do n't matter.
When you feel yourself getting upset, stop and take 10 seconds to think about your response before you do or say anything.
This will keep you from things you regret and will help you become a more mature communicator.
After you stop, ask yourself what's really going on.
What's the real problem here?
Why are you upset?
You may find out that you're really mad about something that happened two days ago, and actually not about having to clean your room.
Think of potential solutions to the problem.
Run through a couple of ways you might react before you pick one.
What will address what's going on?
Consider the consequences.
This is where a lot of people may stumble.
"Doing what I want" is often the most attractive solution, but will it really fix the problem?
Or will it make it worse?
Think about what the result of each option is likely to be.
Pick a solution.
After you've considered the possible consequences of each option, pick the one that seems best for you.
Note that this wo n't always be the easiest or the most fun!
That's just part of becoming more mature.
If you must say something, use a calm voice and give some reasonable arguments to justify how you're feeling.
If the person just wants to argue and does n't want to listen, walk away from the conflict.
It's not worth it.
When you're enraged or about to overreact, take deep breaths and count to 10.
You must maintain self - control and not let wrath get the better of you.
If you have a temper, people may enjoy provoking you.
When you control your temper, they will lose interest in making you angry and will start leaving you alone.
When adults want to communicate maturely, they use assertive techniques and behaviors.
Assertiveness is n't the same as cockiness, arrogance or aggression.
Assertive individuals express their own feelings and needs clearly, and they listen when others do the same.
Arrogant and selfish individuals do n't care about others' needs and are focused on getting what they want, when they want it -- whether or not it makes others miserable.
Learn to stand up for yourself without being arrogant or aggressive, and you'll definitely feel more mature.
Here are some ways to communicate assertively: Use "I" - statements.
"You" - statements make other people feel blamed and shuts them down.
Keeping the focus on what you're feeling and experiencing keeps the way open for productive, mature communication.
For example, instead of telling your parents "You never listen to me!", try using an "I" - statement like "I feel like my perspective has n't been heard."
When you say you "feel" a certain way, the other person is more likely to want to know why.
Life is n't all about you.
It's great to communicate your feelings and needs clearly, but remember to also ask others about theirs.
Being able to put others first is a true sign of maturity.
Do n't jump to conclusions.
If you are n't sure what happened with someone, ask!
Do n't prejudge - remember, you do n't have all the information.
For example, if your friend forgot that you were supposed to go shopping together, do n't assume that it's because she does n't care or is a terrible person.
Instead, use an "I" - statement and follow it up with an invitation for her to express her feelings: "I felt really disappointed when you could n't make it shopping.
What's up? ", Offer to collaborate with others
Instead of saying "I want to go skateboarding," ask others for input: "What would everyone like to do?", Many people and cultures have expectations that mature communicators wo n't curse or swear
Swearing can shock others, or even make them feel as though you're disrespecting them.
Swearing can also cause others to think that you're incompetent or bad at communicating.
Instead of swearing, try expanding your vocabulary.
As you learn new words, use them to express yourself.
If you frequently swear when you're upset or when you hurt yourself, try making it a game to come up with creative exclamations instead.
They may even decide to tune you out.
Screaming is what toddlers do, not mature adults.
Use an even, calm tone of voice, even when you're upset.
Your body can say as much as your words.
For example, crossing your arms in front of you can tell others that you're not interested in what they're saying.
Standing slouched over communicates that you're not really "there" or you want to be somewhere else.
Learn what your body is communicating, and make sure it's what you want.
Hold your arms relaxed at your sides instead of crossing them in front of you.
Stand up straight, with your chest out and head parallel to the floor.
Do n't roll your eyes or stare at the floor.
Examples of mature topics include school, the news, life experiences, and life lessons you have learned.
Of course, you can take some time for being goofy with your friends.
It's all about considering your audience.
You probably wo n't talk about the same topics with your best friend as you do with your math teacher.
Ask questions.
One of the signs of maturity is intellectual curiosity.
If all you ever do is talk at someone, you wo n't seem very mature.
Ask others for their input.
If someone says something interesting, say "Tell me more about that!", Do n't pretend to know something you do n't
It can be hard to admit you do n't know something.
After all, you really want to appear mature and informed.
But pretending to know something only to have it come out that you do n't could make you look (and feel) foolish.
It's much better to say something like, "I have n't read much about that.
I'll have to look into it! ", If you ca n't say something positive, do n't say anything at all
Immature people constantly criticize things and point out flaws about other people, and they do n't hesitate to say hurtful insults by all matters.
Sometimes, they justify cruelty by stating that they're just "being honest."
Mature people choose their words carefully, and they do n't hurt people's feelings in their quest to be "honest," so remember to watch what you say, and do n't say things that hurt other's feelings.
Treat people the way that you want to be treated.
No matter how conscientious you are, you're going to say the wrong thing or inadvertently hurt people from time to time.
We all do stupid things once in a while, because nobody on earth is perfect.
Learn to swallow your pride and say, "I'm sorry."
A genuine, honest apology when you've done something wrong demonstrates true maturity.
This is a really difficult skill to master, but thinking about whether you would want someone to say something to you can help you figure out what to say.
In Buddhism, there's a saying: "If you propose to speak, always ask yourself: is it true, is it necessary, is it kind."
Consider it before speaking.
Those around you will appreciate your honesty, and your compassion will show that you truly care about others.
For example, if a friend asks you if her dress makes her look fat, consider what would be most helpful.
Beauty is very subjective, so offering an opinion on her looks is n't likely to be helpful.
However, telling your friend that you love her and she looks just the way she is could be the confidence boost she needs.
If you really think your friend's outfit is not attractive, there are tactful ways to say this if you think it will be helpful.
For example, "You know, I like the red dress better than this one" does n't judge your friend's body -- nobody needs that -- but it does answer her question of whether she looks her best.
Behavioral scientists suggest that some types of dishonesty are actually "pro-social," little lies you tell to help others avoid embarrassment or hurt.
It's up to you to decide whether this is something you want to do.
Whatever you decide, choose to be kind in doing it.
Prepare the ground at the new location well by incorporating lots of well - rotted manure or compost.
It's best to do this well ahead of time if possible.
Dig up the shrub to be moved in the, fall after the leaves have dropped off, or in early springtime, before new ones form.
This is important, as it will allow you to transfer the shrub as quickly as possible, which prevents the roots from getting stressed or dried out.
To do this, take a tape measure and find a point on the main trunk of the shrub that is 15 centimeter (5.9 in) above the ground.
Measure the trunk diameter at this point , Multiply that by ten to get the size of the root diameter
Once you have the root diameter, you can dig a hole of the same diameter or larger.
If your soil type is sandy, give the shrub a good watering two or three days before moving it.
This will help preserve the root mass when you dig it up.
Dig the root ball out with the back of your spade facing the plant.
You can move it to its new location by placing it on an old sheet or tarpaulin which you can drag across the ground.
If you do n't have time to replant the shrub immediately, you will need to tie up the branches of the shrub to protect them.
Start at the bottom and use a spiral wrapping movement to wrap the branches against the trunk.
Make the roots as compact as possible but avoid damaging the branches by tying too tightly.
Lower the shrub's root ball into its new location and cover with soil.
Do n't tamp the soil down with your feet as this can damage the roots.
Water the shrub well until it's established in its new position.
If you're in the Southern Hemisphere, the North Star wo n't help you navigate.
Instead, find true south using the Southern Cross constellation.
This constellation is always visible in the Southern Hemisphere.
The constellation is made up of 4 bright stars that form a kite shape if you trace the border around them.
Outside the Southern Cross are 2 more bright stars known as the pointers , These are roughly parallel with the 2 stars in the Southern Cross that are closest together
The pointer stars are some of the brightest in the Southern Hemisphere.
If you're having trouble finding the Southern Cross, locating the pointer stars is a good starting point.
Two stars in the Southern Cross, Gacrux and Acrux, are the furthest apart in the constellation.
Starting at the top, imagine a line extending between these 2 stars, and then continuing at the same angle outward.
Hold a strong or a straight stick out in front of you to help envision a straight line.
Depending on the time of year, this line may hit the ground since the constellation rotates along with Earth.
The same way you drew an imaginary line from the Southern Cross, now find the midpoint between the pointers and extend a line outward.
This line should intersect with the line you drew from the Southern Cross.
Use a natural landmark as a reference point.
For instance, a tall tree in the distance could mark the intersection between the 2 lines, indicating where true south is.
When you locate true south, it's simply a matter of turning around to find true north.
Make sure you rotate exactly 180 degrees, or you'll be off - center and not facing true north.
Your personal physical safety should be your number one concern when you are with someone who is angry most or all the time.
If you have children in the house and they experience harm to their physical, emotional, and mental safety, or they witness violence in the household, you need to ensure your own safety and the safety of your children.
Have a plan so you know what to do if your safety is at risk.
If it's possible, obtain an alternate place to stay or stay in a safehouse to ensure your safety.
Use a code word with your children that can be used if anyone is in danger.
Teach them what to do in case you use the code word (for example, they should leave the house and run to a specific friend's house).
If you are able, talk with your friend, neighbor or family member about your safety plan.
Talk over visual cues that you might use if you are in danger.
Identify the nearest exits.
If you ca n't get out of your house, identify safe areas of the house where there are no weapons or other instruments that can be used to hurt you.
Always park your car face out in your driveway and keep the gas tank full.
Carry your phone with you and program in important phone numbers.
If you are having trouble getting away from your situation, call the National Domestic Violence Hotline.
This hotline is staffed with people who can help you come up with a plan.
They can also provide you with a shelter to go to.
When it comes to macular degeneration, the most affected area is the central vision, with the peripheral vision still partially intact.
For this reason, people with macular degeneration can still use their peripheral vision to compensate.
A magnifying glass can help make object seem larger so that they are easier to see.
Magnifying glasses vary from 1.5 to 20 times magnification.
Many can fold up to pocket size.
Try a stand magnifying glass.
This type varies from two to 20 times magnification , It can be mounted so that your hands are free
It is helpful for patients who may also suffer from unstable or shaky hands.
Some types have an additional light feature to aid in dim lighting situations.
With the same variations of magnification as telescopes, binoculars are useful because you can use both eyes to view items.
This type of magnifier is mounted on the patient's glasses and is useful for distance vision.
It allows the patient to transfer between distance viewing and telescopic vision.
There are also spectacle lenses for normal viewing.
These are approved and prescribed by Low Vision Specialists.
This stand - mounted video camera magnifies reading or writing material onto a video screen.
You can use this type of magnifier to aid in a variety of tasks, such as reading, writing, crafts and viewing photos.
Some can also underline and highlight information.
This type of device can also be used with a computer.
This machine will read typewritten text out loud.
These lenses can transition between light and dark areas.
They can be worn over prescribed glasses.

Once the bats are gone, it will be necessary to bar any openings that they might be using to make their way in.
This can be accomplished by repairing longstanding cracks and damage, installing exclusion devices or in some cases applying new mortar, plaster or shingles.
With these things in place, bats will find it difficult or impossible to regain access to your home in the future.
Have a contractor go over the exterior of your home with you to look for places that might admit bats.
It's important that you address each and every possible entry point.
If the bats ca n't get in through one, they'll try to find another.
Vacuum up dried droppings or scoop them into a garbage bag with a plastic scraper , Afterward, scrub the area thoroughly using an enzyme - based cleaning solution
This will help break down any remaining biological waste products so that no traces are left behind.
Be sure to take the proper safety precautions when cleaning bat guano - wear thick rubber gloves, eye protection and a facemask or respirator to filter the surrounding air.
It's highly recommended that you leave the cleanup duties to a professional pest removal service.
Perform thorough inspections of your attic, basement, crawlspace or other affected areas periodically to search for signs of reinfestation.
Look for bats themselves as well as their droppings.
Chances are that bats will stay out after you've sealed their entryways, but if they do happen to sneak back in you'll want to find out as soon as possible to keep the problem from getting out of hand.
Unexplainable drafts or debris can offer a clue that bats have gnawed their way in.
Though they usually wind up in attics and chimneys, bats have also been known to roost beneath decks, inside screened - in porches and under roofing tiles.

In case you are suffering from dry macular degeneration, the ophthalmologist can easily detect the presence of drusen upon inspection.
You will also be asked to look at the Amsler grid, which looks like graph paper.
It is possible that you have macular degeneration when you see that some of the lines are wavy.
To check if you have symptoms, print the Amsler grid test from the Prevent Blindness website and follow these instructions: Place the reversed chart 24 inches away at eye level.
Put your reading glasses on and cover one eye completely with your hand.
Focus on the center dot for one minute and repeat steps with the other eye.
If any of the lines on the grid appear to be wavy, contact your eye care professional immediately.
This method will involve inserting dye into a vein in your arm.
The dye is then photographed as it travels to the veins of the retina.
It can detect leakages, which can indicate wet macular degeneration , The dye should be seen in the optic nerve about eight to 12 seconds after injection
The dye should be seen in the retinal area about 11 to 18 seconds after injection.
This exam will look at the multiple layers of your retina using light waves.
The test can assess the thickness of your retina, the anatomy of the retinal layers, and if there is anything abnormal in the retina like fluid, blood or new blood vessels.
The doctor may first dilate your eyes, though OCT can also be performed through an non-dilated pupil.
Then you will place your chin on the chin rest to stabilize your head, and refrain from moving.
A light beam will be aimed at the eye.
Using light waves, the exam can painlessly detect live tissue in a matter of seconds.
Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is the main chemical that causes the abnormal growth of blood vessels.
When this chemical is suppressed through anti-VEGF agents or antiangiogenics, the growth of the blood vessels can be inhibited.
Your doctor will know if this is a suitable option for you.
One good example of antiangiogenics is Bevacizumab.
The usual dose is an injection of 1.25 to 2.5 milligrams of the drug into the vitreous cavity of the eye.
This drug is usually given every four weeks over a period of four to six weeks.
The antiangiogenics Ranibizumab is given at 0.5 mg, and Aflibercept is given at 2 mg The procedure will be done with the use of a very fine needle together with local anesthesia to prevent pain.
In general, the whole procedure is painless with only slight discomfort.
Some side effects include increased intraocular pressure infection, bleeding, and damage to the lens.
You should obtain better visual acuity within one year . This can begin as early as two weeks and usually peaks by three months after the third injection
This procedure uses a drug and light therapy to help stop blood vessel growth.
It can be an effective treatment for wet macular degeneration only.
This is a two - step procedure done in one visit.
A drug known as verteporfin or Visudyne, will be administered intravenously.
It works by stopping additional blood vessel growth, which occurs in wet macular degeneration, and is done 15 minutes before the photodynamic therapy.
Then, light with a correct wavelength will be applied on the eyes, particularly to the abnormal blood vessels.
The light will activate the verteporfin, which was administered earlier to seal off the leaky blood vessels.
Since the light is tuned to the correct wavelength, it eliminates the threat of visually impairing scar tissue.
Ask your doctor if this therapy is safe for you.
Anti-VEGF is currently the standard of care first line agent, and PDT is sometimes used in conjunction with anti-VEGF therapy , If you experience any sudden headaches, vision changes or any other unexplained pain while undergoing treatment for macular degeneration, visit the nearest emergency facility and immediately contact your eye doctor

Work towards problem solving.
Ask what the person would like to see happen as a resolution.
If you ca n't meet the person's expectations or if the person is being unreasonable, see what you can negotiate. "
Using this language will help show that you are cooperating with the person to resolve the issue in partnership.
For example, you can say, "How can I help you to the point where we can resolve this issue?", If you are trying to come to a compromise, stick with the issue that is immediately happening
Do n't bring up past fights or problems.
Do n't use old grudges to get what you want out of a situation.
It may be that you ca n't arrive at a solution until the person has calmed down.

Networking can feel mercenary and shallow when advertised too overtly.
Understand that networking is essential to success in most industries, but that you should never forget that you're forging connections with people.
Taking a holistic, human approach to your interactions can make you more memorable down the line when it comes time for hiring; employers might have thoughts not just of "Who do I know that would be good for this copywriting job?", but "What job do I know that would be a good fit for Richard?"
Everybody else in your industry understands how crucial networking is, so do n't think you're the only schmuck out there advertising your skill.
Self - promotion is, to some degree, the name of the game.

Make an effort to develop appropriate relationships with the people who come into your store, use your product, or appreciate your work.
Emotions - not prices - are often more of a deciding factor in many purchasing decisions.
Your employees are your support network, and are necessary to your success.
Hire those who are skilled and competent, but also consider how well your employees will mesh together as a team.
Homogeneity should never be prioritized in an effort to have your employees mesh well.
Diverse viewpoints offer myriad advantages to your business as a whole, in both innovation and experience.
Be careful if you're in a situation to hire family members and personal friends as employees.
While connections are the # 1 way in which many jobs are found, nepotism can reflect poorly on you.
Ensure your hires are qualified for the position,

Often, ducks get botulism from living, drinking, and eating in stagnant water.
Ducks can also get botulism from eating from eating small, dead invertebrates, as well as maggots that feed on the carcasses.
Bad food and dying plant life can also give botulism to ducks.
Limiting flies limits the number of maggots in the area, which can carry the bacterium.
Flies can spring up for a number of reasons, especially if the ducks are being raised around other livestock.
Control manure.
Manure is one of the biggest fly attractions.
Make sure to remove manure at least 2 times a week.
It's also important to dry out manure, as the moisture attracts flies.
To dry it out, spread it out thinly in a sunny area, and then scoop it up once it's dried.
Both feed spills and manure spills can attract flies.
Clean them up to help keep flies at bay.
Avoid having drainage ditches with weeds.
These murky areas can attract flies.
Introduce fly - eating species.
For instance, a small form of wasp, the fly parasitoids, has young that eat the pupa of flies, and they do n't bother humans.
The best solution is to burn the animals or bury them away from other ducks.
Dead fish can cause some of the same problems as dead ducks.
If dead fish are in a pond with the ducks, it's best to remove them if possible.
Shallow water tends to be stagnant, and in warm weather especially, it can breed botulism.
It's best to either drain the water off or flood the area to avoid these shallow breeding grounds.
Choose a light colored beer.
Squirt 4 - 6 drops of green food coloring in the bottom of a beer glass.
Fill the mug with beer.
It's best to clear large garden shrubs at a time when birds are n't nesting, to avoid disturbing wildlife.
Aim to clear larger shrubs during the fall or winter to avoid this.
It's usually easier to dig when the soil is fairly dry, so you should also avoid digging after heavy rainfall.
A sharp pair of pruning shears and a small saw will make the job of clearing the shrub a lot easier – remember sharp blades are safer than blunt ones.
A round - bladed spade with a pointed tip will make it easier to dig through the soil, and a mattock will be useful for cutting through the roots.
Also remember to wear appropriate clothing – including sturdy gardening gloves and strong boots.
Use the pruning shears to cut the shrub right back until only a small amount of stump is remaining.
This will make it much easier for you to expose the root ball and pull it out of the ground, which is necessary for completely clearing the shrub.
Leaving the shrub's roots in the ground will simply allow the shrub to grow back.
Use the round - bladed spade to dig a trench around the stump.
Beware of digging close to water or electricity supplies.
Consider calling 811 (the national "call before you dig" service) to find out if any utility lines run beneath that part of your garden.
Using the spade and mattock, cut through the roots as much as possible to make it easier to pull the root mass out of the ground.
Although it's only necessary to remove the root head and main roots to prevent the shrub from re-growing, you should also remove as much of the rest of the root mass as you can to make space for subsequent planting.
If the shrub is small enough, you could try to compost it, otherwise you should consider burning it.
Do n't compost any diseased plant matter you cut away – burn it or put it in the household trash to prevent infection spreading to other plants.
Once you have disposed of the root ball, use a mattock or spade to break up as much of the remaining root in the ground as you can – breaking the root up will help it to rot away naturally in the soil.
It's also a good idea to incorporate some well - rotted manure or compost into the soil now to benefit the next plant that will go in the ground here.

Without completely changing your personality, you can try to be the person that the person you like is looking for in a relationship.
If she complains that her boyfriend never asks about her feelings, make sure to do that.
This is n't as manipulative as it sounds.
If you want to be with the person for a good reason, then you should want to be a good partner to them, right?
Do n't make a big deal about it.
If they complain that their partner never does them favors, bring them lunch or coffee when they're having a busy day at work.
This may backfire, however, because they might just be using you as an emotional dump.
Doing these things and being a good person for the person you like will naturally make you start to fall into the role of a significant other, but do n't do anything too extreme, like get them flowers, or tell them how beautiful they look.
It becomes obvious if you do something romantic like buying extravagant things, and the person may take advantage of this and use you for the gifts.
This does n't mean that you should be at the person's beck and call or to be a lap dog.
It just means that slowly, you should start hanging out a little more... and then a lot more.
Offer to give them a ride to class, grab a casual bite, and propose an innocent game of tennis and until you've become a part of their everyday routine.
Make sure you're not getting obsessive and that your love interest is making some of the calls.
Do n't be too dependable.
The person should see that you have a life of your own -- beyond trying to break up the relationship.
Being more present will help the person see what it would be like to be in a relationship with you.
This should give them a good and more certain feeling about you.
Every couple has its own weakness.
Let's say they're the kind of people who tend to fight when you're out at big, drunken occasions.
Perfect - invite them to your next party.
Let's say the person of your affection's boyfriend spends too much money - tell him about a new gadget he ca n't live without.
Let's say you like a person with a girlfriend who is too obsessed with her appearance; take her on a shopping trip.
Once you pinpoint whatever is wrong with the couple - and there may be many, many, things - you can go about making it so much worse.
Turn that little crack into a gaping hole until they ca n't help but fall in.
If one person in the relationship wants to get married and the other is reluctant, find ways to bring up the subject of marriage.
Talk about your parents' anniversary, invite them to an engagement party, even send them a diamond ring catalog through the mail.
Nothing will make a couple lose interest faster than having a good time hanging out separately.
Invite your love interest's partner out for a fun night - or better yet, introduce them to a person they'd click with even more.
Do what you can to keep the two people apart as much as possible, making sure they actually like what they're doing when they're apart.
Do n't be obvious.
Just casually introduce some activities that would naturally keep them away from each other.
If you really think that the person you like is in a terrible relationship and that they'd be better off with you, then chances are that their buddies feel the same way.
If that's the case, then you should be friendly with their friends without making a spectacle of yourself, just making them think you're a cool person.
This may lead them to ask your love interest, 'Why are you still with that loser?
Why do n't you go out with (insert your name here) instead?
When you're hanging out with the friends of your love interest, do n't hang on to your love interest too much.
Do n't make them think that you're out for their friend; just make them notice that you'd make a great match with their friend.
There's a difference between becoming a closer friend and being available, and acting like you want to hang out with the person you like all the time, in spite of their relationship.
Do n't try to hang out on obvious date nights, special occasions, or times when you know the couple is spending time together.
This will make the person you like suspect that you'd be needy and clingy if you were together - and nobody wants that.
You can make yourself available without texting or calling the person you like every five minutes.
Set your trap and wait for them to come to you.
Nothing will make the person you like realize what they'll be missing faster than seeing you with another potential partner by your side.
This does n't mean you should use somebody to make the person jealous; just spend more time with a close friend of a gender you're attracted to, or go on a few harmless dates and report back about it.
You'll be surprised by how quickly you'll be seen in a new light, and the situation will grow more desperate.
This will make the person think, "Oh no!
Could this mean that I have feelings for them , "Unless it's very obvious that the person is ending the relationship for you, you should not swoop in immediately and start trying to date the person
Instead, you should be a good friend, a sympathetic listener, and just a shoulder to cry on as the person deals with the sad feelings that naturally accompany any breakup - even if it was meant to be.
Tell the person you're always there if they need to talk, and that you ca n't imagine what they are going through.
Still, do n't bad - mouth the other person.
Calling the person's ex a jerk or worse right after the breakup might make the person angry.
Know what would cheer up the person.
Give them a silly stuffed animal or take them out to a comedy.
Just do n't do anything too romantic yet.

The first thing you have to do is find out if your gold is real.
Separating your gold by its karat weight will not only help you begin to assess its value, but it can point out items that are not even gold.
If it is unreadable, you could choose to have the gold tested by a reputable dealer.
There's also the possibility that some of the gold is actually just gold - plated, which a dealer would determine with certainty by performing a chemical test.
Take note that much of the gold jewelry manufactured before 1980 is slightly below its marked karat value.
For example, jewelry marked 18K would actually be between 17K and 17.5 K.
In 1980, the laws regarding the marking and purity of gold jewelry were changed.
If you're still uncertain as to whether or not an item is gold after inspecting it with a magnifying glass, prepare to test it.
You have two options here: the acid test and the Skey test.
The first, the acid test, will require a gold testing kit or the individual parts that make one up (the acid and stone).
Supplies for this test can be purchased from online or physical jewelry suppliers for a small price, and are available separately or as a set.
A kit will come with 10K, 14K, 18K and 22K bottles of testing acid, which will normally be nitric acid.
It will also come with a test stone, also known as a streak stone or touch stone, that will be made from many different materials, including novaculite or other types of flint material.
Kits can also be purchased with an accompanying scale.
For suspected 14K jewelry, rub the item on the stone and place a drop of 14K acid onto the mark it leaves.
If your item is indeed 14K gold, it will stand up to the acid and not change.
If it is 10K, the 14K acid will turn it brown.
If it completely disappears, it is n't even gold.
If it is an unmarked item, go up to the 22K acid incrementally until it turns brown, and when it does, consider it to be the next lowest karat.
For example, if the 18K acid has no effect, but the 22K acid turns it brown, then consider your item to be 18K.
If the 14K acid has no effect, but the 18k acid turns it brown, consider it to be 14k, and so on for other karat fineness tests.
For the Skey test, start by purchasing a gold tester or gold verification pen employing the Skey method.
These testers sell for under $50 and can give a 1000 tests.
This test is a safe alternative to acid and will test accurately on metals such as white gold.
For all suspected jewelry, Slowly write a 1/4 inch line and go over the same line 4 times without removing the pen tip from the test metal.
Immediately write a line on any white paper.
If it is under 10k, the line will be light brown and turn green within seconds If it is 10k, the line will be light brown.
If it is 14k, the line will be dark brown.
If it is 18k, the line will be orange.
If it is 22k, the line will be yellow.
If it is 24K, the line will be red.
If there is no line at all, it is not gold.
If you have gold coins, they may have a numismatic (coin) value which is above their metal value.
This tends to be based on age, rarity, and overall condition.
In this case, your best option is to take it to a coin dealer for assessment.
This is definitely worth doing, as you may be able to get more money that way.
If you have experience auctioning items online, you may be able to sell the coin online, but you may need a certificate of authenticity to persuade buyers to pay top dollar.
It also makes sense to have a secure payment system in place to make customers feel safe with their transaction.
The benefit of an auction (provided you're aware of the coin's real value) is that it may go well beyond your asking price if several collectors are bidding for the coin.

Do you think your anger will subside, or is this really the end?
Friends fight and still stay friends, and you ca n't expect perfection from them all the time.
But if you're fighting more than feeling friendly, it's probably time to bail.
Who wants to be with someone they're always arguing with, anyway?
Ask yourself some questions to better understand things: Was your disagreement a one - time occurrence or has been ongoing?
If your disagreement just wo n't die, maybe the friendship should.
Does the issue itself matter more than the friendship?
Voting for different people is one thing, but if someone deeply disagrees with your core beliefs, it may be a deal - breaker.
Is there a hurt or a slight that neither of you will apologize for?
Are you so proud / upset that you ca n't say "I'm sorry" and move on with your lives?
Sometimes friendships do n't end with a fight, but with a fizzle.
Has it been a while since you felt like calling up your friend for a chat?
Do you find yourself making excuses not to hang out?
If so, ask yourself whether you or your friend could do anything to save the relationship, or whether you even want to.
People change - it sucks, but it is true.
Do n't fight it if you do n't have a reason to.
If you're old friends, give it another shot.
People go through rough patches, and it's no excuse to cut and run because things are n't fun for a few weeks.
Drifting apart does n't mean you wo n't one day drift back together.
Just stop hanging out for a while - it's as simple as that.
Rushing from "best friends" to "I'll never see them again" is childish and extreme.
Would just hanging out less accomplish the same goals?
Does it make you sad to imagine life without the person, or does it make you feel relieved?
If you are n't sure this is what you want to do, then just try seeing less of them.
It's a lot easier, less dramatic, and mature than cutting them out of your life all at once.
Simply put, are you still willing to put in the energy to keep this relationship going?
If the answer is no, then move on and make the break.
If you already know that you'll be happy to get rid of the drama, boredom, or other negative feelings that you associate with this person, ending it is a good idea.
Ignore the mutual friends, activities, and other nonsense.
If they're bad for you, end it.

Sometimes losing the worst people hurts you the most.
You had good times, though.
They were cool, fun, and funny when you were friends.
Losing them, no matter how bad things got, is going to feel like ripping off a bandage.
It hurts, and it stings in the open air, but it's for the best.
Your friend might not take it well.
One or both of you might end up crying, begging, or flying off in rage.
But whatever the current emotions, they do not erase the reasons you had for ending things.
You're going to feel guilty, end of story.
Just remember that, no matter how broken your relationship may have been, it's normal to feel responsible for the death of a good thing.
It will pass with time.
Chances are good that your friend will be angry enough for the both of you.
Hurt feelings morph quickly into anger, and anger leads to doing things you'd probably rather not do.
If you feel tempers rising on either side, take a step back and get out of there shortly.
Like cookies on a hot tray, you'll both cool off faster when you're separated.
If your former friend tends to become aggressive when confronted, you should expect verbal or even physical backlash.
End things in public, and bring a friend or write a letter if you're really worried.
You're going to be angry for a while if your friend hurt you.
It's normal.
But do n't let your anger pull you to the dark side, young padawan.
Once you let the friendship go, let the emotions go as well.
More likely than not, it's impossible to completely break it off, especially if you still have to see the person at school or work.
Passive aggression, the great weapon of slighted friends the world over, can only hurt you if you let it.
Get mentally ready to deal with some mind games in the months after you cut things off.
The best defense is completely ignoring the attack.
If your former friend is passive - aggressive, expect back - stabbing behavior after you break off the friendship.
Try and remember that it is, in the end, kind of your fault for ending things and that you should n't strike back.
You already ended the relationship.
Do n't make things worse by trying to sabotage or hurt them after you've already ended it.
It is just hard for people to be friends with two people who are no longer friends for each other.
People will naturally gravitate toward either you or your friend because playing both sides puts them in the middle of the war they want none of.
Note, however, that this is by far the most melodramatic outcome.
Meeting new people will signal to your former friend that you have a life outside of him or her.
It will also help you feel better about the friendship's end since you'll have great new people in your life.
Some fresh ideas will do you good - as long as you're on the lookout for behavior similar to the friend you had to leave.
Interacting comfortably with others shows confidence and poise.
It is much easier to come up with subjects to discuss if you are educated in a variety of skills and topics.
Go to the library and read a variety of books.
Read up about history, science, sociology, psychology, or anything else that you are interested in.
Scan the internet, and read reputable websites to keep up with current events.
Read a newspaper (either online or in print) and be educated about current events in your community as well as the world.
This way, you can start a conversation by asking, 'Did you hear about ?
What do you think about it?
Learn new hobbies and activities.
Some examples include learning how to: play an instrument, dance, do yoga, rock - climb, skydive, surf, snowboard, ski, scuba - dive, paint, draw, or sing.
This way, when you meet a new person you have plenty of activities to discuss.
Chances are, the other person will have some similar interests.
When attending social gatherings, be a "listener" rather than always driving the conversation.
People love being listened to and gravitate to people who take the time to listen to them.
Relax, breathe and pretend you're talking to someone you've know all your life.
Ask questions and be interested.
Focus solely on the person and his or her experience rather than on what you are going to say next.
Be present in the moment.
Ask open - ended questions rather than closed - ended "yes" or "no" questions.
This will help increase the likelihood that you have a positive and continued conversation.
Use active listening skills, which help to build understanding and trust.
One way to show that you are listening is to restate what the person has just said.
Say something like: That sounds really tough.
It sounds like you are hurt, and that makes sense given the situation , If you talk about negative things too much you may seem like a complainer and someone who lacks poise
However, if you focus on positive subjects people may notice your elegance and charm.
Ask positive questions such as, What's going well for you?
What have you been doing that's fun lately?, Generally avoid conversations about politics and religion unless you share the same mentality and openness toward these subjects
Assertiveness is generally being respectful and open about your feelings and thoughts while maintaining tact and composure.
Assertive communication is warm, welcoming, and friendly.
One way to be assertive is to be understanding of others and their situations, while still respecting and communicating your own needs and desires.
For example, you might say, That is a great idea.
How about we also do this?
Show you are assertive through your body language.
Give appropriate eye contact (not staring, but not avoiding, look around every once in a while).
Be relaxed in your body; Do not make your body too small (hunched shoulders) or too large (hands on hips).
Do not use aggressive forms of communication such as putting people down, calling them names, or raising your voice.
Saying how you feel or think when you know it might hurt other people can also be a form of aggressive communication; some things are better left unsaid (negative comments about how someone looks or acts, for example).
These types of speech and actions may show that you are aggressive, and can indicate to others that you are losing your cool.
Some cities offer "finishing schools" where social skills are taught.
The occasional rustling in the attic may just be an old water pipe or the sound of the house settling.
Make sure you've excluded all other possibilities before you begin spending time and energy on a bat - removal project.
The best way to tell that you have bats in your home is to see one with your own eyes or come across their tell - tale droppings.
Consult a pest removal specialist or wildlife expert to determine what type of bats are commonly found in your area.
Should you encounter bat guano in any part of your home, there's a good chance that bats have recently been roosting there.
While bat urine is n't typically visible, it may leave behind small stains and a sharp odor.
Bat guano sometimes contains fungal mold spores that may be hazardous to breathe.
In some cases, prolonged exposure to guano can lead to serious health concerns, including hemorrhagic fever and respiratory infections like histoplasmosis.
There are many different varieties of bats.
Find out when maternity season begins for your local bat population.
If you drive off the mother after she's given birth, her babies wo n't be able to survive.
This will leave you with an unbearable stench and an attic full of dead bats to dispose of.
Bats live in a wide range of highly specialized conditions.
In most cases it's possible to narrow down the species by the region it occupies.
This will give you an advantage when coming up with a strategy for safely managing the isolation and removal of your unwanted guests.
See if you can get a good enough look at a bat that's entered your home to be able to reference what species it is.
Bats gravitate toward dark, enclosed spaces because they most closely resemble their natural cave habitats.
Take a look around your attic, chimney flue, basement or crawlspace and see if you can turn up evidence that bats have been roosting there.
Pay special attention to areas accessible through small cracks and apertures, as bats often use these as entry points.
Bats are capable of squeezing into spaces as narrow as ⅜ ths of an inch, so do n't discount small or inconspicuous openings.
Watch bats as they come and go at night to see what entrances they're using.
This constellation, also known as Ursa Major, is the key to finding the North Star (Polaris), the star that shows you where true north is in the Northern Hemisphere.
This is a large constellation, and finding it on a clear night is easy.
The Big Dipper gets its name because it looks like a large spoon and is made up of some of the brightest stars in the sky.
Look up and find the collection of stars that look like this.
Contrary to popular belief, the North Star is not the brightest star in the sky.
The outer edge, what looks like the end of a spoon, is made up of 2 stars.
These 2 stars are known as' pointers, 'because they literally point towards the North Star.
This line should extend through the top of the spoon.
The North Star sits at the end of this line.
The North Star forms the end of the handle on the Little Dipper and is the brightest star in that constellation.
When you think you've found the North Star, look around it and see if it's part of a small, spoon - shaped constellation.
If so, then you've located it.
When you're facing the North Star, you're facing true north.
You can now use this knowledge to figure out the other directions.
Remember if you're facing north, the other directions from right to left are east, south, and west.
Sometimes the weather does n't cooperate with this method , In this case, you can still find the Big Dipper and estimate the distance to the North Star
The North Star is approximately 6 times the distance between the 2 pointer stars.
Look at the space between those 2 stars and then multiply that distance by 6.
This gives you the approximate location for the North Star.

A complete cleaning involves discarding all of the used bedding, not merely "spot cleaning" the dirty spots.
After removing the old bedding, wash the bottom and sides of the cage with soap and water, rinse thoroughly, then place fresh, new bedding in the cage.
After washing with soap and water, you can use a 10% white vinegar and water solution (1 part vinegar to 9 parts water) as a rinse before drying the cage bottom.
Using the vinegar solution once a week (each time you fully clean the cage) may help eliminate odors and remove buildup that water ca n't.
Particularly if you have multiple guinea pigs in one cage, you should clean out parts of the cage daily in addition to the once - a-week deep cleaning.
To spot - clean, remove and discard any areas of soiled bedding at the end of the day.
Spot cleaning will become easier if you can train your guinea pigs to use a litter box.
Identify the area that your guinea pigs tend to use as a toilet area , Then place a litter box made for small mammals in that corner of the cage
If they change the area in which they use the toilet, try moving the litter box to the new area.
Clean out the litter box every 1 - 3 days depending on how much it is used.
Never place clumping cat litter in a guinea pig's litter box.
Guinea pig - safe bedding material is the most appropriate option.
Check your local pet store for products that are safe and effective for guinea pigs.
To use a cage - cleaning spray, remove all used bedding from the cage.
Spray the tray of the cage liberally with the cage cleaner.
Use a rough towel to wipe away cage cleaner and loosened debris from the bottom of the cage.
Allow the cage to dry completely (in the sun if possible), place fresh bedding in the bottom of the cage, and return your guinea pigs to their home.
You may want to continue using soap and water to clean the cage in addition to the cage cleaner.
Bedding formulated to block odors, such as Carefresh, can keep the cage smelling fresh longer.
Place 1 - 3 inches of bedding in the bottom of your guinea pigs' cage.
Be sure to scoop out wet or soiled bedding daily.
Though odor - blocking bedding can make the guinea pigs' cage smell better, you should still clean the cage well and completely replace the bedding at least once every week.
Baking soda is marketed as odor - controlling, but it can cause irritation and should not be used.

Bats favor dark, quiet hideouts and have an aversion to lots of light and commotion.
Try leaving a light on in the attic or another area you think bats might be inhabiting.
For a two - pronged approach, you might also invest in a white noise machine and leave it running overnight to double your chances of scaring them off.
It's against the law to exterminate bats in places where they're considered a protected species, which means you'll have to find a non-lethal way to get rid of them.
Hanging strips of aluminum foil from the ceiling can create a series of obstacles that will disorient and repel bats.
Bat boxes are small enclosed structures that provide a hospitable temporary environment for bats seeking a place to roost.
The idea is to flush them out of your home while giving them somewhere else to go so that they wo n't be tempted to return.
For people living in wooded areas, bat boxes can be a good way to relocate bats without the need for more costly measures.
You can construct your own bat box from scratch or ask your local pest control or wildlife removal service how to obtain one.
Set up your bat box near the treeline of your property or alongside your home in a place with ample shade.
By fitting suspected entry points with a one - way valve or tube, invading bats will be free to exit a space but wo n't be able to get back in.
This way, bats will simply leave on their own.
Exclusion devices are arguably the most effective method for ridding your home of bats once and for all.
Denying bats reentry is preferable to trapping them, which is often difficult and dangerous.
Exclusion devices can be found at most pet stores and home improvement centers and are relatively simple to install.
If you're not having any luck getting rid of the bats on your own, or you suspect you might be housing an entire bat colony, your best bet is to have the problem dealt with professionally.
Pest control specialists will be able to pinpoint the places where bats are likely getting in, then remove them and seal vulnerable entry points to keep them from coming back.
This will be the safest and most convenient option if you can afford to have it done.
In places where environmental conservation is a high priority, you may be able to find a team of wildlife experts to remove bats from your home at no cost.
If you use iTunes to pay for Netflix, you'll need to adjust your plan settings through iTunes itself instead of the Netflix website.
If you're already signed in, you can skip these steps.
Make sure to use the same Apple ID that you use to pay your Netflix bill.
This will open your account page in iTunes.
You'll be asked to enter your Apple ID password again.
This will allow you to make changes to your iTunes subscriptions, including Netflix.
You'll be asked to confirm that you want to make the change.
Your changes will take effect on your next billing date.
In most regions, you will have three plan options: One Screen in Standard Definition (SD), Two Screens in High Definition (HD), and Four Screens with HD and Ultra HD (UHD).
The more expensive plans will provide higher - quality video and allow more people to watch at once.
Not all options are available in all regions.
If you began your membership before 5/10/2014, you'll only see the two - screen option.
To see all of the available options, you'll need to cancel your subscription and then resubscribe.
If you started your account after 5/10/2014, you should see all of the available options.
Resilience is the ability to bounce back after difficulties, frustration, and significant stress.
Resilience does not mean that you toughen up so much that you do not experience negative events, just that you can move on from them.
Adaptation to new circumstances is a key feature of resilience.
Essential factors in developing resilience are having a supportive emotional network, feeling confident in yourself and your abilities, and using problem solving skills.
Understanding the specific source of your pain will help you better prepare to face the issue head on.
Tracking your feelings in a journal is a good way of seeing how often and, more importantly, why you feel frustrated or upset.
Once you see a pattern, you can decide where to focus your energy.
Instead of trying to negate or remove your feelings, realize that accepting your emotional distress is a way in - and - of - itself to cope with life's ups and downs.
You do n't have to be superhuman.
Emotional avoidance can actually work against you by building up stress below the surface.
Suppressing your pain can backfire and diminish your sense of well - being.
Allow yourself appropriate time to sit with your emotions and acknowledge and feel them before moving on.
Sometimes, just sitting to have a good cry or breathing through your anger is the necessary first step.
If this is your goal, make sure you're completely certain it's the right thing.
If the breakup is caused by an outside force (you), and not a natural problem in the relationship, the couple may still harbor feelings for each other which might grow stronger over time.
If you want to break up the person of your dreams and their significant other, then, like Othello's Iago (but far less devious), you have to get in the middle of the couple, slowly but surely.
To do this, you have to get the person you like to trust you and to begin to open up to you.
Be understanding, agreeable, and sympathetic, and show that you're a good listener.
At first, the person may not open up to you about their relationship, but that time will come.
Just one warning: there's a difference between being the confidant of your love interest, and in falling into the Friend Zone with that person.
Make sure you do n't act too buddy - buddy or friend - like with the person or they wo n't ever be able to see you as a love interest.
If one of the partners finds out, you are sure to fail.
This does not work 99 percent of the time.
Every relationship has flaws, and the chances of a couple past honeymoon stage and dating for a few years breaking up is low.
The worst thing you can do is openly criticize the person's relationship, criticize the person's partner, or generally make the person feel like they are in a doomed relationship.
This will make the person feel angry, defensive, and more determined than ever to make things work.
No one wants to admit to a failure, especially not in a relationship, so you have to wait for the person to naturally admit a problem on their own.
You can start by just letting the person talk about the relationship.
For example, if you know that her band was playing at a local venue the night before but that her boyfriend did n't show up, innocently ask if he liked her show.
Ask questions about how the person's night went.
If they seem kind of upset, just say, 'How was your weekend?' , and wait for them to reveal the rest
Ask, "How did that make you feel? , Keep it broad with general questions that encourage the person to keep talking - and to start seeing the cracks in their relationship
Unfortunately, you may be trying to break up a couple that is in a great relationship, which would make it difficult for the person to reveal anything negative.
But if you've made yourself the person's confidant, it's less likely that the relationship is in great shape.
Once the person does start revealing the flaws with their relationships and all of the problems with their partner, the worst thing you can do is to completely agree or to say, "You deserve so much better than that."
This will make the person see that you have ulterior motives.
Instead, act a bit withdrawn or confused, forcing the person to talk for longer and explain why they are really unhappy - and why their partner is n't perfect.
If the person has to explain their frustration further and you keep them talking, then they will notice the problems even more.
Just keep the person talking any time something negative comes up.
Not criticizing their relationship will also make things better down the line.
If you do end up together, no one can tell them that you sabotaged the previous relationship.
When you ever openly criticize one of the partners, especially if your plan has failed, it proves you were trying to screw up the relationship.
It can also help when conversation is not productive or is escalating and a break is warranted.
Breathing deeply can be effective in regulating emotions.
Give the person these instructions: Breathe in for a count of four, hold for a count of four, and exhale for a count of four.
Make sure they are breathing with their diaphragm rather than with their chest.
When the person breathes with their diaphragm, their belly extends out (they should be able to feel it with their hand).
Do this as many times as necessary until the person starts feeling calmer.
Tell the other person that they do n't need to react right away.
Counting can help put off angry feelings for the moment.
Suggest that the other person gives themselves time to sort out feelings by counting to 10.
Help the person take their mind off the anger by distracting them.
You can tell a joke or watch a video.
You can reassure the person that you care about their anger, but you can also say that it may be a good idea to change their focus for a few minutes to help them cool off.
Removing the person from a situation will help them calm down.
Suggest going for a walk, getting outdoors, or otherwise removing themselves from the situation.
Let a trusted friend or family member know your situation.
Know where your escape route is.
Have a phone with you at all times.
Call a domestic violence hotline.
"Subtracting 1 from a number takes you backwards 1 number.
For example, 4 - 1 = 3.
For instance, you add the doubles 5 + 5 to get 10.
Just write the equation backward to get 10 - 5 = 5.
If 5 + 5 = 10, then 10 - 5 = 5.
If 2 + 2 = 4, then 4 - 2 = 2.
For example: 3 + 1 = 4 1 + 3 = 4 4 - 1 = 3 4 - 3 = 1 For example, + 1 = 6 (the answer is 5).
This also sets the foundation for algebra and beyond.
You want to subtract 42 - 37.
You start by trying to subtract 2 - 7 in the 1s column.
However, that does n't work!
Borrow 10 from the 10s column and put it into the 1s column.
Instead of 4 10s, you now have 3 10s.
Instead of 2 1s, you now have 12 1s.
Subtract your 1s column first: 12 - 7 = 5.
Then, check the 10s column , Since 3 - 3 = 0, you do n't have to write 0
Your answer is 5.
It's important to make sure that the other person feels like you're taking them seriously.
Let the person speak and listen to what they are saying.
Do n't interrupt or correct the other person while they are speaking.
You do n't necessarily have to agree with the other person, but you can show that you understand why they might feel the way they do.
For example, you might say, 'If I felt like I was n't getting equal treatment, I'd probably feel upset too.'
Agreeing with the angry person might help diffuse the angry feelings.
It helps the angry person feel like they are right in some manner.
Use "open - ended" questions to probe for more information.
Open - ended questions ask for more than a simple answer like yes or no.
Then you can get to the root of the problem.
For example, you might say, "What happened at the meeting this morning?"
Use the word "exactly" to get more information.
For example, "What exactly do you mean when you say nobody listened to you?", Show that you want to understand what the other person is talking about
Paraphrase what they say so that you are sure you understand correctly.
For example, you can say, "Let me see if I have this right.
You went to the meeting and were asked to give a last - minute presentation, which made you feel stressed.
Then, your boss checked his phone the whole time, which made you feel ignored.
Do I have that right?
Shake hands with a solid, firm grip, and look right into that person's eyes.
If your culture has a different way to greet others, use that form in an appropriate and polite way.
When you meet someone new, make a good effort to remember the person's name by repeating it: "Nice to meet you, Wendy."
Good manners communicate that you respect the other person, which is the behavior of a mature person.
Throughout any conversation, listen carefully and maintain eye contact.
Do n't stare at the other person, though.
Use the 50/70 rule: make eye contact for 50% of the time when you're talking, and 70% of the time while the other person is talking.
Avoid fidgeting or fiddling with random objects.
Fidgeting is a sign that you lack confidence.
Keep your hands open and relaxed.
Do n't sit there thinking about places you'd rather be.
Most people are very good at noticing when you do n't care about an interaction, and it will hurt their feelings.
Do n't talk on your cell phone or text people while you should be paying attention to the person in front of you.
When you enter a new situation or new community, keep quiet for awhile and notice how other people are acting.
It's not your job to tell other people what they should or should n't do.
Instead, watch and be respectful.
Using good online etiquette shows that you respect your friends, family and other people that are hanging out with you online.
It's a sign of maturity.
Keep in mind that a lot of what you say online can also be seen by people like potential employers, teachers, and others, so do n't say things that would embarrass or hurt you.
Avoid strong or offensive language.
Do n't overuse exclamation points.
Remember that you are n't there in person to clarify your point, so make sure not to overwhelm your audience.
Use your shift key.
Capitalize proper nouns and the beginnings of sentences instead of writing in all lower - case letters.
Avoid using nonstandard cApitaliZaTion.
It makes your writing much harder to read.
This is the internet equivalent of shouting.
This may be okay if you're posting a tweet about how your hockey team just won the championship, but it's not a good idea in daily emails and social media posts.
When sending an email, use a salutation (the "Dear" in "Dear John").
Starting an email without one is rude, particularly if it's to someone you do n't know well or to someone like a teacher.
Also use a closing, such as "Thank you" or "Sincerely."
Proofread before you send an e-mail or make a social media post to make sure you did n't make a mistake.
Go easy on abbreviations, slang and emoticons.
It's okay to use these in a casual text to a friend, but do n't use them in an e-mail to your teacher, or in another situation where you want to look mature.
Remember the golden rule online, just like the golden rule in real life.
Treat others the way you want to be treated.
If you want someone to be nice to you, be nice to them too.
If you do n't have anything nice to say, do n't say anything at all.
Hold doors, help pick things up, and offer assistance to anyone who needs it.
Consider being helpful in your community as well, like being a mentor to a younger student, tutoring, or working at an animal shelter.
When you make others happy, you're more likely to feel happy yourself.
Serving others rather than just yourself is a very mature behavior.
Helpful acts may also boost your self - esteem.
Studies have shown that when we help others, we get a sense of accomplishment and pride in what we've done.
Being helpful is n't always a two - way street.
There may be times when you help others and they do n't say "thank you" or offer to help in return.
That's on them.
Remember that you're being helpful for you, not to get anything from anyone else.
When you constantly take over conversations and talk about yourself all of the time instead of giving other people a chance to talk, it shows disrespect and immaturity.
Showing a genuine interest in the interests and experiences of others can make you seem more mature and less self - centered.
You might also learn something new or develop a new respect for someone based on what you hear.
If somebody compliments you, say "thank you" and leave it at that.
If someone criticizes you, be polite and say something "Okay, I'll definitely think it over."
Maybe the criticism is n't valid, but handling it politely makes you look mature in the moment.
Try not to take criticism personally.
Sometimes, people may be trying to help and are n't communicating well.
If you think that's the case, ask for clarification: "I heard you say that you did n't like my essay.
Could you tell me some more specifics so I can do better next time?. Sometimes, the criticism says much more about the person giving it than it does about you
If the criticism seems unfair or hurtful, remember that the other person may just be trying to make him or herself feel better by tearing you down.
Do n't let it get to you.
Accepting criticism gracefully does n't mean you ca n't stand up for yourself.
If someone hurts your feelings, tell them in a calm and polite way: I'm sure you did n't mean it this way, but when you criticized my outfit it really hurt my feelings.
Next time, could you not make comments about my appearance?
Kids need some direction in terms of how to deal with their own anger.
Not many people know how to instruct their kids on how to deal with anger, so many are left to themselves to deal with it on their own.
This can lead to poor impulse control, a history of violent behaviors, and fighting in relationships in school and at home.
Children learn their behavioral patterns from their parents and other adults with whom they spend a lot of time.
In order to teach your child mutual respect, you must try your best to communicate respectfully with your child.
Instruct your kids to treat others with kindness.
They should n't be sarcastic toward other people.
Do n't yell or shake your finger at them.
Do n't shame your kids, call them nasty names, or put down their actions even if they did n't exhibit the best of judgment.
Do not use guilt trips on your kids.
If your kids stray from communicating respectfully, do n't accuse them of disrespecting you.
It will hurt their feelings.
If your kids are young, they probably do n't even realize they are acting in a disrespectful manner.
If it's your teen, let them know in an assertive way that their tone sounds angry and ask them what is going on.
In other words, just make the observation without getting upset.
Use a non-accusatory tone.
Give them a chance to explain.
Make sure your face is relaxed.
Use a tone of voice that does not sound angry or tense.
Behavior such as throwing things or hitting should not be allowed.
Just like adults, kids have the right to feel angry.
It's okay, you're allowed to be angry, and people do get angry sometimes.
You might be feeling other feelings along with anger too, and that's okay also. "
For younger kids, a shorter, more direct reflection statement is more helpful.
Reflection can help children learn to name the emotion and learn how to deal with feelings appropriately.
Try saying, "You are angry that you did not get to eat the cookie before dinner."
Do n't worry that it might not be the right emotion - they will correct you.
The key is just getting them to refocus on how they are feeling.
Help your kid identify more feelings if it's possible, since anger almost always occurs with other feelings specific to the situation.
For example, your kid could be angry that their little brother entered their room without permission.
Your kid can also feel a little violated.
If you notice your teen or kid stewing for a while, sit down with them.
Count out loud for them, taking a few deep breaths with them.
Breathe in for a count of four, hold for a count of four, and exhale for a count of four.
They will need this skill throughout their life.
In addition, some kids really prefer to calm themselves down.
With some kids, it's possible to distract them long enough to get them to move on from something they are focused on.
This is easy for young kids.
Distraction is a way to deal with emotions to calm them down.
Change the scenery and bring your kid out to the garage to help you with something small.
A small task like this can help take the focus away from what's upsetting them.
Then you can discuss the issue later with them.
As your kid discusses their issue and what caused them to be angry, listen to them carefully.
Paraphrase and summarize what you think they have said.
This will show that you are following their story.
For children, it is key to teach them the difference between feelings and behaviors.
It is perfectly fine to be angry or upset, but we have to show that in the right way.
This is especially true for children who externalize their anger and hit, kick, or destroy things.
Your child still might be upset and jump around in their story.
By asking questions, you can help your child organize their thoughts too.
For instance, if something at school upset your child, try to sum up what they are saying: "Let me see if I'm following your story.
Billy pushed you during lunch time.
You told the teacher, but the teacher just told him to stop, but you felt that the teacher should have punished him.
Did I get this right? "
For instance, if your kid has a falling out with friends, acknowledge that your kid has a right to be angry and upset.
Your child might be feeling hurt.
It might take a while for these feelings to resolve, but assure your child that the feelings eventually will fade away.
This will shift the focus away from the anger and focus on problem - solving.
Encourage your kid to think of solutions where everyone wins, which will ensure cooperation in the house.
You can offer some suggestions too, but it is also effective to let your child come up with solutions.
Your child may feel more in control when he gets to determine how to solve the problem.
He is also learning how to resolve his own problems, which is a skill he will need throughout life.
You are teaching your kids major life skills, so following these steps each and every time will help this lesson sink in.
In some cases, your child might be angry because they have been wronged.
Whether it's bullying or because of unkind treatment from peers, your kid might have a really good reason to be angry.
If there are situations where your child needs protection, like a bullying situation, demonstrate how this situation should be handled assertively.
Go to your school's principal for help and alert your child's teachers.
Keep going up the chain of command until you reach a positive solution.
Being patient in tough situations will help show your child what it's like to work out problems.
One day per month, spend fifteen minutes with a notebook to write down all of the things you are grateful for.
Do n't stop until you've come up with at least ten things.
Keep the list, and add on to it every month.
Use this list to remind yourself that your life is full, and think about how grateful you are for the people in your life.
Then, go out and tell them!
Sure, giving your friend, family member, or significant other a gift on his or her birthday is a nice gesture.
But an even nicer and more spontaneous gesture will be when you give your friend a gift because you are grateful that you know this person.
Doing so will make both of you all the happier.
It does n't have to be brand new or expensive.
It could be a souvenir, a used book, or a piece of jewelry.
What's important is showing your friend know that you are grateful; the price of the gift matters much less.
This is another great way to show gratitude.
Giving away an old shirt you do n't care about is one thing, but giving your favorite sweater to your little sister or your best friend is another.
If you have something that you're attached to but that you do n't really have a use for, give it to someone who can actually use it, even if it means a lot to you.
This kind of giving can be contagious; think about how the good you do may spread beyond its direct source!
Getting into the habit of giving away things you love will make you less selfish, and less attached to all of your possessions.
Go for a hike or a run in the park.
Take a long walk on the beach.
Surround yourself in nature, immerse yourself in its beauty, and focus on the gift of the present moment.
Being in awe of the beauty of nature can make you more grateful for what you've got and more willing to give to others.
Being out in nature can also help you put things into perspective.
You'll have a much harder time viewing your own little perspective as all - important when you're standing at the bottom of a gushing and powerful waterfall.
Any time someone does something that really matters to you, take the time to get a thank you card.
Be sure to mention exactly how much what this person did meant to you.
Do n't just send the cards to teachers, co-workers, or professors; get in the habit of writing the cards to near and dear friends, to show them that you notice their efforts and are grateful for them.
Buy a pack of ten thank - you cards.
Make a goal of using them all within the year.
Install the router software.
Open the router's configuration page.
Enter your Internet connection information.
Set your wireless settings.
Apply your settings.
Place your router.
You'll want to avoid touching the pimple with your finger nails, but just in case you do, having them clean will reduce the likelihood of irritation and infection.
Consider using a fingernail brush to get dirt out from under your fingernails.
Put on disposable gloves just before you're ready to pop the pimple.
Not only will this put a barrier between any remaining bacteria on your fingers (and in your fingernails) and your skin, but it will also prevent the sharp edges of your nails from impacting the pimple.
If you do n't have disposable gloves, you can cover your fingers with clean tissues.
When you pop the pimple, you'll be opening the skin, creating a way for bacteria to enter.
The pimple will heal faster if you do n't give bacteria a chance to settle in and create a new or worse infection.
Do n't scrub the area too hard, or you'll irritate it further.
Gently cleanse the area, rinse it with warm water, and pat it dry with a towel.
Determining the weight of your scrap gold will help you to calculate its base value.
This does n't necessarily represent the price you will get, but it's good to have this figure as a reference when starting negotiations.
Purchase a jeweler's scale.
Such a scale is available online for less than $50.
This is the best way to accurately weigh your gold, as jeweler's scales are built to be more precise than a typical gram scale you might have in your home.
Use a food scale if you can not purchase a jeweler's scale.
If you have a food scale in your home, you can use it to weigh your gold.
Most inexpensive food scales weigh only by the ounce, so make sure you evaluate the functionality of the scale if you are purchasing one specifically to weigh your scrap gold.
If you are unable or unwilling to purchase your own scale, take your scrap gold to a jeweler for weighing.
Be sure to weigh your items in groups, based on their particular karat.
Place your items on the scale and allow it to settle before taking the reading.
Depending on the scale, there may be an arrow that settles near an exact gram amount, and you take your measurements from that.
However, more expensive scales will have a digital readout that makes calculations as easy as reading the screen.
The conversion ratio is 28.3495231 grams per ounce, or about 14.175 grams per half ounce.
Usually, you wo n't have a full ounce of gold for any particular karat, and if you do, it will only be for a single karat fineness, so having all your calculations in the same weight measurement makes things much easier later in the process.
Bullying behavior often emerges from a sense of insecurity or poor self - esteem.
It can be a way for people to try and assert their power over others.
Bullying is bad for people who are bullied and for those who do the bullying.
If you find yourself engaging in bullying behavior, talk to someone you trust, like a parent or school counselor, about how to stop.
Bullying falls into three basic types: verbal, social, and physical.
Verbal bullying involves things like name - calling, threatening others, or making inappropriate comments.
While words do n't cause physical harm, they can cause deep emotional wounds.
Watch what you say, and do n't say something to someone that you would n't want them to say to you.
Social bullying involves doing damage to someone's social reputation or relationships.
Shunning others, spreading rumors, humiliating others, or gossiping are all types of social bullying.
Physical bullying involves hurting someone (or someone's things).
Any physical violence, as well as taking or destroying someone's stuff or making rude gestures, are forms of physical bullying.
Do n't allow bullying to happen when you're around, either.
While you do n't have to get physically involved with a bully - in fact, that can be really unsafe - there are plenty of ways for you to help create a bully - free environment.
Try: Setting a good example by not bullying others.
Telling bullies that their behavior is n't funny or cool.
Being nice to victims of bullying.
If you feel like you have a bullying problem, consider talking with a counselor or therapist.
Maybe you have some deeper issues that are making you feel like you need to belittle or pick on others.
A counselor can give you approaches to develop more positive relationships.
Gossip, rumor - mongering, and backstabbing can hurt other people just as much as if you'd punched them in the face - maybe even more.
Even if you do n't mean gossip maliciously, it can still do damage.
Mature people care about others' needs and feelings and do n't do things that could cause hurt.
Gossip wo n't necessarily make you cool or popular, either.
Studies have shown that gossip may make you seem cool when you're in fifth grade, but by ninth grade (when you're hopefully more mature) gossipers are generally seen as less likeable and less popular.
Do n't encourage gossip either.
If someone tries to initiate gossip when you're around, speak up: research shows that when even one person says "Hey, I'm not cool with gossiping about other people" it can really make a difference.
Sometimes, you may say something nice about someone and it can end up translated by other people as gossip.
For example, maybe you told a friend 'I really like hanging out with Ziyi.'
She's so funny!, and someone else told someone else that you said something mean
You ca n't control how other people interpret or respond to what you say.
The only thing you can control is what you say and do.
Make sure that your words are kind.
A good test to determine whether something is gossip or rumor is to ask yourself: Would I want other people to hear or know this about me?
If the answer is no, do n't share it with others.
If you can let it go, do n't reply; your silence will communicate that what the person said was not okay.
If you ca n't let it go, simply tell the person that their comment was rude.
If the person apologizes, accept the apology; if there's no apology, just walk away.
Mature people are open - minded.
Just because you have never heard of or tried something, does n't mean you should shut it out or dismiss the possibility.
Instead, look at it as an opportunity for you to learn about something (or someone) new and different.
If someone has a different belief or habit than you do, do n't judge it immediately.
You'll be surprised what you learn.
Ask for clarification.
If someone says or does something that does n't seem right, ask for clarification before you make a snap judgement.
For example, if you think someone just insulted your beliefs, take a deep breath and then say something like, 'I heard you say.'
Is that what you meant?, If the other person says s / he did n't mean it that way, accept it
Do n't expect the worst from people.
Go into situations expecting that everyone else is human, just like you.
They probably wo n't try to be mean or hurtful, but they may also make mistakes.
Learning to accept people just as they are will help you be more mature.
Sometimes, you just wo n't agree with someone else.
That's okay.
Sometimes you just have to agree to disagree - that's part of being mature.
Do not apologize for any quirks or oddities that you may have, even if others do n't approve.
As long as your behaviors are n't antisocial and wo n't cause anyone harm, you should feel free to express your individuality.
Mature people do n't second - guess themselves or try to be something that they are n't.
Developing hobbies and skills you're good at is a great way to build your self - confidence.
You'll learn that you can accomplish whatever you set your mind to, and have a cool set of skills to share with others.
Watch out for that inner critic.
If you notice negative thoughts about yourself, think about whether you'd say them to a friend.
If you would n't do it to a friend, why would you tear yourself down?
Try rewording these negative thoughts into helpful ones.
For example, you might think 'I am such a loser!'
I suck at math and I'll never get any better.
This is n't a helpful thought, and it definitely is n't something you'd tell a friend.
Reword it in terms of what you can do about it: I'm not great at math, but I can work hard.
Even if I do n't make an A in the class, I'll know I did my best.
A mark of true maturity is being true to who you are.
You can have self - confidence without acting arrogant or pompous.
A mature person does n't have to tear others down or pretend to be something s / he's not to feel good about him or herself.
Talk about things that truly interest you.
When you care about something, it shows.
When you have negative thoughts about yourself, it can be tempting to go overboard denying them.
For example, if the thought "I really am worried about this test next week" shows up, your first reaction might be to pretend "Nothing scares me!", This is n't true to yourself
It's more mature to admit when you're feeling insecure or vulnerable.
Everyone has moments when they do n't feel confident.
That's totally normal.
Express your feelings clearly.
Beating around the bush or being passive aggressive are n't mature or genuine ways to deal with your feelings.
Be polite and respectful, but do n't be afraid to say how you really feel.
Do what you think is right.
Sometimes, other people may mock or criticise you for it.
However, if you stick to your principles, you'll know you've been true to yourself.
If people do n't respect that, you do n't want their good opinion anyway.
Possibly the most important part of becoming a more mature person is accepting responsibility for your own words and actions.
Remember that things do n't simply happen to you.
You are an agent in your own life, and your words and actions have consequences both for yourself and others.
Own up when you make mistakes.
Recognize that you ca n't control what anyone else does, but you can control what you do.
Accept responsibility when things go wrong.
For example, if you do badly on an essay, do n't blame it on the teacher.
Think about what actions you took to get you to that result.
What can you do better next time?
Focus less on whether something is fair.
Things will not always be fair in life.
Sometimes, you may deserve something that you do n't get.
Mature people will not allow unfairness to stand in the way of their accomplishments.
Take control of what you can.
Sometimes it can feel like you do n't have any control over your life.
Some of this is true.
You ca n't control whether the manager of the restaurant gives you a job, or whether that person you like will agree to go out with you.
But there are things you can control.
For example: For the job: You can polish and proofread your resume.
You can prepare for the interview as well as you can.
You can dress professionally when you interview for the job.
You can show up on time.
You may still end up not getting the job, but you will have done everything within your control.
For relationships: You can be respectful, funny, and kind.
You can be yourself around the other person.
You can be vulnerable and tell him / her that you'd like to have a relationship.
These are things you are in control of.
Even if things do n't work out, you can rest easy knowing you stayed true to yourself and gave yourself the best shot.
Do n't accept defeat.
Most of the time, people give up because it's easier than trying again.
It's much easier to say "I'm a loser" than it is to say "Well, that approach did n't work out, let's see what else I can do!", Accept responsibility for your choices and choose to keep on trying, no matter what
Work on decreasing your stress level.
Use feedback as an opportunity to learn.
Take control of your life.
Remember that the world is not out to get you.
Practice forgiveness, of yourself and others.
Listen to the way people talk to one another and use those conversations and patterns in your dialogue to make it sound authentic.
You'll notice that people talk differently when they're with different people, so make sure that you include that when you're writing dialogue.
Disregard parts of the conversation that will not translate well when written down.
For example, every "hello" and "goodbye" does not need to be written.
Some of your dialogue might start with a "Did you do 'this'?"
To get a good feel for the balance that you need in your dialogue between realistic speech and book speech you need to read good dialogue in books and in movies.
Checking out and practicing writing dialogue for screenplays and radio plays is really useful in developing dialogue, since those are both very dependent on dialogue.
Douglas Adams, from the above writers, got his start writing radio plays, which is one reason for his fantastic dialogue.
You will need to completely understand your characters before you can make them talk.
You'll need to know things like whether they're taciturn and monosyllabic, or whether they love to use lots of big words to impress people, and so on.
Things like age, gender, education level, region where they're from, tone of voice, will all make a difference in how a character talks.
For example, a poor American teen girl is going to talk very differently from a rich, old, British guy.
Give each character a distinct voice.
Not all of your characters are going to use the same vocabulary, tone or method of speech.
Make sure each character sounds different.
Stilted dialogue might not completely kill a story, but it can definitely jerk a reader out of the story, which as a writer, is something you're trying not to do.
Stilted dialogue is dialogue that only works on the obvious levels and in language no one would use.
For example: "Hello, Jane, you look sad today," said Charles.
"Yes, Charles, I am sad today.
Would you like to know why?
"" Yes, Jane, I would like to know why you are sad today , "" I am sad because my dog is sick and it reminds me of the death of my father two years ago under mysterious circumstances
"How the dialogue above should have gone:" Jane, is something wrong , "asked Charles
Jane shrugged, keeping her gaze fixed on something out the window.
"My dog's sick.
They do n't know what's wrong , "" That's terrible, but, Jane... well, he is old
Maybe that's all it is.
Her hands clenched on the windowsill.
It's just, it's just, you'd think the doctors would know.
The reason the second one works better, is that it does n't come right out and say that Jane is thinking of her deceased father, but it does lean towards that interpretation, especially with her using the word "doctors" instead of "vet".
It also flows better.
This is a good choice for a book that's written in the style of old epics, like Beowulf or The Mabinogion.
Botulism poisons the duck, causing what's sometimes known as "Limberneck Disease."
It causes paralysis, starting with the duck having trouble taking off or going under the water.
The duck's legs will be paralyzed, and you may see the duck trying to move only with its wings.
The duck's eyelids and neck will droop.
The paralysis may also be accompanied by diarrhea.
Once you realize a duck is sick, move it away from the area where it was infected.
You should provide some basic shelter for the duck.
Leaving the duck where it is means the duck will continue to be infected with the bacterium.
You have to move it away from the source if it's going to recover.
However, not all ducks will recover.
Only a duck that did n't get a lethal dose of the bacterium will be able to recover.
When you first notice the symptoms, it's important to provide fresh water for that duck.
The water may help flush out the bacterium.
If the duck wo n't drink, use a syringe to give the duck fresh water.
The two main antitoxins are Trivalent (A, B, E) Botulinum Antitoxin and Heptavalent (A, B, C, D, E, F, G) Botulinum Antitoxin.
You can get the first from the CDC (your local office), and you will likely need to get the second through a vet, who will get it from the CDC.
The second is recommended for more types of botulism.
Ducks are most often affected by Type C Botulism, which generally does n't cause problems for people, dogs, or cats.
Botulism can sometimes be caused by a wound that lets the bacterium into the blood.
If your duck has wounds, you should have a vet look at them, as they may need to be treated surgically.
Most ducks who are going to recover from botulism will do so withing 2 days.
If your duck makes it that long, it will likely be fine.
Work along with your teacher.
Do your homework the same day as it's assigned.
Make an effort outside of class if you need help.
Pursue something important to you.
Strike a balance between work and play.

An ophthalmologist will determine which stage of AMD you have based on the amount of drusen found in your eyes.
Drusen are white or yellow deposits found in the retina.
Early stage: Medium - sized drusen equivalent to width of a hair strand and no vision loss.
Intermediate stage: Large drusen and / or pigment changes; typically no vision loss.
Late stage: This consists of two types: Geographical atrophy / dry macular degeneration: The photoreceptors in the macula are damaged.
The eyes can not use light to convey vision to the brain.
Fluid builds up in and underneath the macula and causes visual changes.
The onset is much faster than dry macular degeneration.
Dry macular degeneration is due to a degeneration of the cells in the retina.
The degeneration or drying of these cells and the lack of excess fluid gives it its "dry" name.
These cells are also known as photoreceptors, or cells that use light entering the retina to help our brain understand the images via the visual cortex.
Basically these light sensitive areas help us to understand what we are seeing.
The degeneration occurs because fatty lipids called drusen build up in the macula as we age.
This build - up is seen during an eye exam as yellow spots on the macula.
AMD does not lead to total blindness, but it can drastically inhibit the central fields of vision.
The "dry" form of macular degeneration is more common compared to its "wet" form.
The following are the signs and symptoms of dry macular degeneration: Blurring of printed words.
More light needed when reading.
Difficulty seeing in the dark.
Difficulty in recognizing faces.
Greatly diminished central vision.
Noticeable blind spot in the field of vision.
Gradual vision loss.
Geometric shapes or inanimate objects mistakenly identified as people.
This kind of AMD happens when blood vessels grow abnormally underneath the macula.
Because of the macula's growing size, the blood vessels may begin to leak or ooze fluid and blood into the retina and macula or, rarely, they may fully rupture.
Though wet macular degeneration is less common than dry macula, it is a more aggressive visual disease that can lead to blindness.
The cause for macular degeneration is unknown, but several studies have stated that there are risk factors that can lead anyone to develop the condition later on in life.
Its signs and symptoms include: Straight lines that look wavy.
Visual blind spot.
Loss of central vision.
Rapid vision loss.
No pain.
Scarring of the blood vessels, which may lead to irreversible loss of vision if not addressed promptly.

If you're wearing a revealing swimsuit and you're not a fan of body hair showing, you're going to need to spend some time shaving before you go to the beach.
Take some time to shave your legs and any other areas that might need it, such your bikini line or armpits, before you go.
If you're not comfortable shaving or waxing these areas yourself, let a professional do it.
Set up an appointment to get a bikini wax done.
If you're guy, you may want to shave your back or have someone do it for you.
Make sure to check yourself out in the sunlight, as you're more likely to spot hairs in the sun.
To make your skin shimmer, you may want to spend some time exfoliating.
Exfoliating is just a way of removing dead skin so that you skin does n't look ashy or rough.
You have the option of using a chemical exfoliant or a physical exfoliant.
A chemical exfoliant uses chemicals, generally acids, to break down the dead skin.
A physical exfoliant uses small beads or crushed pieces of seed or shell in a solution to rub away the dead skin.
You'll also find exfoliating gloves that fall in this category.
Even a washcloth is a physical exfoliant.
To use an exfoliant, hop in the shower first to get your skin damp.
Rub the exfoliant in with your hand, a glove, or washcloth in gentle circles.
Wash the exfoliant away when your done.
If you're using an exfoliating glove or washcloth, simple put your normal soap on it, and use it to rub the soap into your skin in gentle circles.
Be sure to focus on problem areas like knees, elbows, and feet.
After you exfoliate, apply a good moisturizer to your skin.
If you're looking for a flat stomach, try to avoid foods that cause you to bloat for a couple days before the beach.
That way, your stomach wo n't be pooched out because of bloating.
Skip cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli, cabbage, Brussels sprouts, and cauliflower.
Also skip processed foods and carbonated beverages.
Instead, try other healthy foods such avocados, eggs, nut butters, salmon, bananas, Greek yogurt, and lemons.
Whether starting on paper or on the computer screen, your character must exist somewhere, even if that somewhere is virtual nothingness.
It may be an apartment in Paris, or a parking lot in Poughkeepsie, New York.
Where, who, what, when, why and how... Education, school, occupation, workplace, purpose, Conflict, dilemma, opportunity, choices / actions (benefits and consequences), Health, sexuality, mentality, stages of life, danger, triumph / defeat, growth / decay, death,... If you're at the point of creating a character, chances are you have at least the idea of a plot / story in mind.
If you're creating a grand, sweeping narrative such as The Lord of the Rings, you will need an entire world of characters - some good, some evil, some male, some female, or whatever other gender comes to mind and even some that are neither good nor evil, neither male nor female.
If you're creating an introspective story, you may not need more than a single character.
Unlike what first comes to mind when you think "character," not every character in a story is human.
For example, in Tolkien's Lord of the Rings, the mountain Caradhras functions as a character, filled with a cold malice, whereas in Hemingway's "The Old Man and the Sea," a marlin is one of the main characters.
Who you need depends on your story, of course, but by starting with broad criteria, you can start to make decisions that will gradually define your character by reduction, much like the sculptor removes all the excess marble, revealing the statue buried within it.
A pattern includes a culture and the individual traits (common / everyman or heroic, tyrannical, superman or ogre).
You'll likely want a protagonist (hero) and antagonist (villain), as conflict is the basis of plot.
Maybe you need a secondary character such as a henchman, a best friend, a romantic interest, a sidekick, or a significant other.
Note that sometimes, what you think of as the protagonist - the good guy - is painted as the antagonist , For example, Kong in King Kong
You might need anti-heroes, like Clint Eastwood in Pale Rider; sympathetic "villains" such as Lennie Small in Of Mice and Men; wild cards like Jack Sparrow in Pirates of the Caribbean; a femme fatale (an irresistible woman who leads her man into greatness, difficulty, danger or disaster) like Jessica Rabbit in Who Framed Roger Rabbit; treacherous friends like Iago in Othello or Petyr Baelish in Game of Thrones; or perhaps a trickster guide like Smeagol in Lord of the Rings.
Each of these characters began as archetypes, and then became more defined as the stories were fleshed out.
Once you have your character's archetype defined, you can add traits and features, remove things the character is not, and generally start to reveal the sculpture buried in the marble.
Ask yourself what you want your audience to feel about your character: love, pity, revulsion, compassion - or nothing at all.
Begin to draw your character based on your desired outcome.
Determine whether the character is male, female, or otherwise.
This will inform the character's general point of view, suggest traits depending on archetype, and may even be a point of conflict for your character and your story when seen through the eyes of society's preconceptions, whether fair or not.
For example, an arrogant male is perceived differently than an arrogant female.
(Both of which further define your character!), Age is also a factor to consider.
Older is generally seen as wiser, but it comes into play in other ways as well.
A young villain is generally portrayed and seen as a bad seed or simply insane.
An old villain can be all that, but might also be twisted that way by life's circumstances - giving him a lot more depth.
The young, idealistic hero elicits a different feeling than the world - weary vet who is just doing the right thing.
And when either of those meets their end in the story, the reactions are different as well.
Sometimes these can be contradictory.
Don Quixote was a crotchety old man who'd spent his life in a room reading chivalry novels, and was woefully naive.
Yet it was this naivety that drove him to seek adventures and love, and to create fantastic imaginings from the world around him when reality did n't meet his expectations.
In a horror tale, the protagonist may want to survive at all costs - for example, Ripley in Alien; in a romantic tale, the antagonist may want to stop the hero from getting his "true love," as did Prince Humperdinck in The Princess Bride.
How your characters deal with the inevitable obstacles that stand between them and their aims will most clearly define them.
In complex stories these might cross repeatedly, with the motivations and accomplishments of some characters getting in the way of others, generating further action and twists, and cumulatively raising the stakes.
To really flesh out a character, give them a personality that goes beyond the story itself.
Some parts of their personality may never make it into your story, directly, but will help inform the decisions your characters may have to make.
Make a list of likes and dislikes, and make sure the list is balanced.
In other words, do n't have 10 dislikes to every one like or vice versa.
A character's attitude is likely made up of complementary traits, which can lead to actions that are unexpected and could change the audience's perception of your character.
For example, the character that loves freedom is likely to dislike authority; if they like rich cakes or flashy cars, they're unlikely to respect frugality or restraint.
If your character is merciless, but unexpectedly rescues a helpless child from a burning building, the audience is forced to rethink his character completely.
Good habits, bad habits, or just things the character ca n't stop doing without some serious discipline or counseling.
This can be minor, such as biting fingernails (which would indicate a worrier), or obsessive hair - combing (vanity or insecurity); or as serious as a drug addiction (somebody who evades responsibility and craves escape), or a death wish (hopeless and forlorn).
The more of these little tics and traits you give your character, the more they will "come alive" in the audience's mind.
Work on external features such as where he lives, what she looks like and whether or not he has any pets, etc..
Most details you choose should suggest something about the character, or the characters' history.
It creates a much more realistic character and helps to develop the character's archetype.
A popular hero strength / weakness has to do with loyalty / disloyalty.
Look at people at the mall, or on the subway.
Note physical features - the shape of noses, jaws, ears, body shapes, how their clothes fit, or how they carry themselves.
If you like their look, describe to yourself the details you find attractive, and translate that to your characters.
If you see somebody that looks scary, honestly tell yourself why that person scares you, even if the reason is totally irrational or politically incorrect.
Use this information to inform your characters.
Create characters that combine these traits - do n't base an entire character on one or two people, because if they find out, you might get in trouble.
Matching your character's traits to our perception of objects can help define your character, and be useful for foreshadowing moods and actions.
For example: A rose blooms briefly, but people adore them.
A snake is volatile and can strike without warning.
Thunderstorms are violent, but presage a surge of growth to come.
A sharp sword is even a danger to the hand that wields it.
First of all make a mind map of all the things you've talked about, and all the things you want to decide about your character.
Get a voice recorder - most phones or laptops have them - and interview yourself, or even better get your friend to interview you as the character.
Then write it down, and fill your mind map, to uncover things you did n't know about your character and develop the personality.
If you make a mistake in the recording just remember that you can always branch out into multiple possibilities from a given idea.
Feel your character, and put yourself in his / her / its shoes.
Sometimes the best characters are created from your own ideals, character, flaws or strengths, and those of family members and friends / foes.

Committing yourself to a fulfilling pursuit allows passion to pick up the slack on those days that you're not feeling especially driven.
Passion does n't translate to 'fun 24/7,' but it should be meaningful to you in some capacity.
The effort you exert should always be on something that will make you proud in the end, or will at least put you one step closer to what it is that you really want to do.
Healthy work life balance is essential to long - term success and a worker's well - being.
But as might be expected, when you're starting out, more ambition means longer hours.
Passion for your work will help to keep those hours you spend burning the midnight oil meaningful.
Diving too hard into work without giving yourself a break will increase your stress levels and decrease your effectiveness.
Set boundaries on your workday, and take frequent breaks to recharge your batteries.
Do n't confuse your work for who you are.
Finding time and space away from our work - even if it is our life's passion - can often provide insight on that work.
The more meaningful your work is to you, the tougher this can be, but great, as they say, is the enemy of good.
Focusing too intently on creating the perfect, most ideal iteration of that pitch, graphic, or copy can leave you with one excellent piece of work, instead of the ten pieces you needed.
Find a balance in your work that satisfies you, your boss, and your client without causing the rest of your life to suffer.
Employers prize those employees who can deliver solid work dependably over those who occasionally produce great stuff but repeatedly miss their deadlines.
When you're beginning a new enterprise, it might feel presumptuous to speak of your career like it's the real deal.
Doing so, however, will help others see you seriously, and will help you see yourself seriously as well.
If you're starting a business, do n't equivocate.
Refer to it as' work, 'and even when you work from home a certain room can be' the office. '
It's alright to have a sense of humor about it, but do n't undermine your efforts.
When someone else is angry, especially at you, it can be easy to get angry as well.
But when you are trying to communicate with an angry person, it's better for you to keep your own anger out of it.
Calm yourself down before you respond.
Force yourself to stop and take a few deep breaths.
Maybe even count to five (or 10 if you need more time).
Remember that the other person's anger likely has nothing to do with you.
Do n't take this person's anger personally.
Instead, step outside of the direct line by transforming your feelings into curiosity about the person's anger.
Ask yourself questions like: This person is really angry.
I wonder what got them so upset?
Do n't raise your voice or speak in a tone that conveys anger.
Take a couple of deep breaths if you need to, and speak with a level, calm voice with a normal volume.
Having open, welcoming body language can help diffuse another person's anger.
They will see that you are not being antagonistic.
Avoid encroaching on the other person's personal space as a way to avoid making them uncomfortable or angrier.
Giving them space also means that, should they try to strike you, you will be able to move out of the way.
Gently touching the other person's shoulder, if they will allow it.
Keep in mind that touch is n't always appropriate.
If the angry person is a spouse or close friend, then a touch may be appropriate.
If the angry person is a customer or client, it would not be appropriate.
If 4 x 4 = 16, then 16 / 4 = 4.
Divide the number to the left of the division symbol, or the divisor, into the first number under the division symbol.
Since 6 / 2 = 3, you'll write 3 on top of the division symbol.
Multiply the number on top of the division symbol by the divisor.
Bring the product down under the first number under the division symbol.
Since 3 x 2 = 6, then you'll bring a 6 down.
Subtract the 2 numbers that you've written , 6 - 6 = 0
You can leave the 0 blank also, since you do n't usually start a new number with 0.
Bring the second number that is under the division symbol down.
Divide the number that you brought down by the divisor.
In this case, 8 / 2 = 4.
Write 4 on top of the division symbol.
Multiply the top right number by the divisor and bring the number down , 4 x 2 = 8
Subtract the numbers.
The final subtraction equals zero, which means that you have finished the problem , 68 / 2 = 34
Some divisors wo n't divide evenly into other numbers.
When you've finished your final subtraction, and you have no more numbers to bring down, then the final number is your remainder.

The probiotics (good bacteria) in yogurt have been shown to reduce the length and intensity of diarrhea.
The most helpful strains of bacteria include Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus reuteri, Saccharomyces boulardii, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Bifidobacteria bifidum.
You can also get probiotics in pill or powdered form.
The pills and powders usually contain a wide range of helpful strains of bacteria.
Research shows that ingredients in cocoa target and disable the protein that causes the intestine to secrete water.
A little chocolate can therefore help solidify your stool.
If making cocoa, add very little milk, as it is hard on upset stomachs.
A tablespoon of carob powder mixed with applesauce can help soothe your stomach , 9 - 30 grams of psyllium seed taken daily will thicken your stool, lessening the intensity of diarrhea

Markkula was averse to confrontation, so he decided to bring in a president, Mike Scott, to keep a tighter rein on Jobs.
Markkula and Scott had joined Fairchild on the same day in 1967, had adjoining offices, and shared the same birthday, which they celebrated together each year.
At their birthday lunch in February 1977, when Scott was turning thirty - two, Markkula invited him to become Apple's new president.
Calhoun had been at Reed with Jobs, Friedland, Kottke, and Holmes.
Like the others, he became deeply involved with Eastern spirituality, dropped out of Reed, and found his way to Friedland's farm , There he moved into an eight - by twenty - foot chicken coop that he converted into a little house by raising it onto cinderblocks and building a sleeping loft inside
In the spring of 1975 Brennan moved in with him, and the next year they decided to make their own pilgrimage to India.
Jobs advised Calhoun not to take Brennan with him, saying that she would interfere with his spiritual quest, but they went together anyway.
"I was just so impressed by what happened to Steve on his trip to India that I wanted to go there," she said.
"Do n't make it cute," Jobs ordered.
Janoff came up with a simple apple shape in two versions, one whole and the other with a bite taken out of it.
The first looked too much like a cherry, so Jobs chose the one with a bite. He also picked a version that was striped in six colors, with psychedelic hues sandwiched between whole - earth green and sky blue, even though that made printing the logo significantly more expensive
Atop the brochure McKenna put a maxim, often attributed to Leonardo da Vinci, that would become the defining precept of Jobs's design philosophy: "Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication."
CHRISANN AND LISA
He Who Is Abandoned
Jobs and his engineers significantly improved the graphical interface ideas they saw at Xerox PARC, and then were able to implement them in ways that Xerox never could accomplish.
The improvements were in not just the details but the entire concept.
The mouse at Xerox PARC could not be used to drag a window around the screen.
And he settled into a serious relationship with one of Regis McKenna's employees, a beautiful Polynesian - Polish woman named Barbara Jasinski.
Markkula was only thirty - three, but he had already retired after working at Fairchild and then Intel, where he made millions on his stock options when the chip maker went public. He was a cautious and shrewd man, with the precise moves of someone who had been a gymnast in high school, and he excelled at figuring out pricing strategies, distribution networks, marketing, and finance.
Despite being slightly reserved, he had a flashy side when it came to enjoying his newly minted wealth , He built himself a house in Lake Tahoe and later an outsize mansion in the hills of Woodside
When he showed up for his first meeting at Jobs's garage, he was driving not a dark Mercedes like Valentine, but a highly polished gold Corvette convertible.
"When I arrived at the garage, Woz was at the workbench and immediately began showing off the Apple II," Markkula recalled.
"You could tell that if he could screw you, he would n't.
'If it comes out well, I'll invest,' Markkula said, 'and if not, you've got a few weeks of my time for free.', Jobs began going to Markkula's house in the evenings, kicking around projections and talking through the night
"We made a lot of assumptions, such as about how many houses would have a personal computer, and there were nights we were up until 4 a.m.," Jobs recalled.
Markkula ended up writing most of the plan.
"Steve would say, ‘ I will bring you this section next time, 'but he usually did n't deliver on time, so I ended up doing it."
She and Lisa moved to a tiny, dilapidated house in back of a home in Menlo Park.
They lived on welfare because Brennan did not feel up to suing for child support.
Finally, the County of San Mateo sued Jobs to try to prove paternity and get him to take financial responsibility.
His lawyers wanted Kottke to testify that he had never seen them in bed together, and they tried to line up evidence that Brennan had been sleeping with other men.
Jobs left, and Hertzfeld went back to his work.
Later that afternoon he looked up to see Jobs peering over the wall of his cubicle , 'I've got good news for you,' he said
"What's more important than working on the Macintosh?", Jobs demanded
"Steve and I were in and out of a relationship for five years before I got pregnant," she said , "We did n't know how to be together and we did n't know how to be apart."
When Greg Calhoun hitchhiked from Colorado to visit them on Thanksgiving 1977, Brennan told him the news: "Steve and I got back together, and now I'm pregnant, but now we are on again and off again, and I do n't know what to do.", Calhoun noticed that Jobs was disconnected from the whole situation.
He even tried to convince Calhoun to stay with them and come to work at Apple.
"Steve was just not dealing with Chrisann or the pregnancy," Calhoun recalled.
"He could be very engaged with you in one moment, but then very disengaged.
There was a side to him that was frighteningly cold. "
But because he was so obsessive when it came to selecting furnishings, it remained mostly barren, lacking beds or chairs or couches.
Instead his bedroom had a mattress in the center, framed pictures of Einstein and Maharaj - ji on the walls, and an Apple II on the floor.
These historical legacies limit the extent to which China will be able to share in global leadership, which requires some degree of compatibility between Chinese and Western values.
The West claims that its values are universal, and the US and Europe will not cease pressing those values on China.
It is hard to see this process going into reverse, with China starting to export its own values.
Raskin envisioned a machine that would sell for $1,000 and be a simple appliance, with screen and keyboard and computer all in one unit.
To keep the cost down, he proposed a tiny five - inch screen and a very cheap (and underpowered) microprocessor, the Motorola 6809.
Raskin fancied himself a philosopher, and he wrote his thoughts in an ever - expanding notebook that he called "The Book of Macintosh."
It had a research team of only four engineers located in the original Apple office space next to the Good Earth restaurant, a few blocks from the company's new main building.
The work space was filled with enough toys and radio - controlled model airplanes (Raskin's passion) to make it look like a day care center for geeks.
Every now and then work would cease for a loosely organized game of Nerf ball tag.
Andy Hertzfeld recalled, "This inspired everyone to surround their work area with barricades made out of cardboard, to provide cover during the game, making part of the office look like a cardboard maze."
So everybody - households, companies, banks, state enterprises, government people - were selling the Vietnam dong, "said a businessman who asked to remain anonymous.
At one demonstration of the technology, he arrived late, fidgeted awhile, then abruptly cut off the engineers in the middle of their presentation with a brusque "Thank you."
They were confused , "Would you like us to leave?", one asked
Then he and Apple hired two engineers from Hewlett - Packard to conceive a totally new computer.
But the economy has struggled to build on that promise.
Jonathan Pincus, an economist and dean of the Fulbright School in Ho Chi Minh City, said the country's large trade deficit - US$ 12.4 billion in 2010 - is a sign that the previous growth strategy was past its sell - by date.
An early showdown came over employee badge numbers.
Scott assigned # 1 to Wozniak and # 2 to Jobs.
Not surprisingly, Jobs demanded to be # 1.
"I would n't let him have it, because that would stoke his ego even more," said Scott.
Jobs threw a tantrum, even cried.
Finally, he proposed a solution , He would have badge # 0
Scott relented, at least for the purpose of the badge, but the Bank of America required a positive integer for its payroll system and Jobs's remained # 2.
Markkula wrote his principles in a one - page paper titled "The Apple Marketing Philosophy" that stressed three points.
The second was focus: "In order to do a good job of those things that we decide to do, we must eliminate all of the unimportant opportunities.", The third and equally important principle, awkwardly named, was impute
It emphasized that people form an opinion about a company or product based on the signals that it conveys.
"People DO judge a book by its cover," he wrote.
"We may have the best product, the highest quality, the most useful software etc.; if we present them in a slipshod manner, they will be perceived as slipshod; if we present them in a creative, professional manner, we will impute the desired qualities."
State - owned shipbuilder Vinashin embarked on a flurry of investments, racking up debts of US$ 4.4 billion that eventually saw it plunge into quasi-bankruptcy.
There was, however, one programmer who was infusing the project with some life: Bill Atkinson , He was a doctoral student in neuroscience who had experimented with his fair share of acid
When he was asked to come work for Apple, he declined.
But then Apple sent him a nonrefundable plane ticket, and he decided to use it and let Jobs try to persuade him.
"We are inventing the future," Jobs told him at the end of a three - hour pitch.
"Think about surfing on the front edge of a wave.
It's really exhilarating.
There was something larger at stake.
The cheaper microprocessor that Raskin wanted would not have been able to accommodate all of the gee - whiz graphics - windows, menus, mouse, and so on - that the team had seen on the Xerox PARC visits.
Raskin had convinced everyone to go to Xerox PARC, and he liked the idea of a bitmapped display and windows, but he was not as charmed by all the cute graphics and icons, and he absolutely detested the idea of using a point - and - click mouse rather than the keyboard.
"Some of the people on the project became enamored of the quest to do everything with the mouse," he later groused.
"Another example is the absurd application of icons.
An icon is a symbol equally incomprehensible in all human languages.
There's a reason why humans invented phonetic languages. "
It is a far cry from the 1990s when Vietnam, then described as the next Asian 'tiger economy', bounded onto the world stage with a seemingly unstoppable roadmap to success - opening up vast swathes of unexploited land and mobilising a young and cheap labour force.
The Apple II took the company from Jobs's garage to the pinnacle of a new industry.
Its sales rose dramatically, from 2,500 units in 1977 to 210,000 in 1981.
But Jobs was restless , The Apple II could not remain successful forever, and he knew that, no matter how much he had done to package it, from power cord to case, it would always be seen as Wozniak's masterpiece . He needed his own machine
More than that, he wanted a product that would, in his words, make a dent in the universe.
Years later Jobs was remorseful for the way he behaved, one of the few times in his life he admitted as much: I wish I had handled it differently.
I could not see myself as a father then, so I did n't face up to it.
But when the test results showed she was my daughter, it's not true that I doubted it.
I agreed to support her until she was eighteen and give some money to Chrisann as well.
I found a house in Palo Alto and fixed it up and let them live there rent - free.
Her mother found her great schools which I paid for.
I tried to do the right thing.
But if I could do it over, I would do a better job.
One of Atkinson's amazing feats (which we are so accustomed to nowadays that we rarely marvel at it) was to allow the windows on a screen to overlap so that the "top" one clipped into the ones "below" it.
Atkinson made it possible to move these windows around, just like shuffling papers on a desk, with those below becoming visible or hidden as you moved the top ones.
Of course, on a computer screen there are no layers of pixels underneath the pixels that you see, so there are no windows actually lurking underneath the ones that appear to be on top.
To create the illusion of overlapping windows requires complex coding that involves what are called "regions."
Atkinson pushed himself to make this trick work because he thought he had seen this capability during his visit to Xerox PARC.
Atkinson discovered Smith working in Apple's service department and, amazed at his ability to improvise fixes, recommended him to Raskin.
Smith would later succumb to schizophrenia, but in the early 1980s he was able to channel his manic intensity into weeklong binges of engineering brilliance.
Raskin's manifestos about an inexpensive machine for the masses, with a simple graphic interface and clean design, stirred his soul.
And it was also inevitable that once Jobs set his sights on the Macintosh project, Raskin's days were numbered.
"Steve started acting on what he thought we should do, Jef started brooding, and it instantly was clear what the outcome would be," recalled Joanna Hoffman, a member of the Mac team.
"But it's a very massive level slide.
It's an avalanche of a dimension of 1,000 meters by 1,000 meters.
And it is about 70 to 80 feet thick.
In addition, he had begun to suffer a variety of afflictions, ranging from eye infections to narcolepsy.
When Scott was on vacation in Hawaii, Markkula called together the top managers to ask if he should be replaced.
Most of them, including Jobs and John Couch, said yes.
So Markkula took over as an interim and rather passive president, and Jobs found that he now had full rein to do what he wanted with the Mac division.
THE MAC IS BORN
You Say You Want a Revolution
Jef Raskin's Baby
In order to make the project his own, Jobs decided it should no longer be code - named after Raskin's favorite apple.
In various interviews, Jobs had been referring to computers as a bicycle for the mind; the ability of humans to create a bicycle allowed them to move more efficiently than even a condor, and likewise the ability to create computers would multiply the efficiency of their minds.
"Burrell and I thought this was the silliest thing we ever heard, and we simply refused to use the new name," recalled Hertzfeld , Within a month the idea was dropped
Moreover, to be a world economic power, China requires a currency in which foreigners want to invest.
That means introducing full convertibility and creating a deep and liquid financial system, a stock market for raising capital, and a market rate of interest for loans.
And, while China has talked of "internationalizing" the renminbi, it has done little so far.
"Meanwhile," writes Chi, "the dollar is still supported by the strong US political relations with most of the world's largest foreign - reserve - holding countries."
Japan, South Korea, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates all shelter under the US military umbrella.
Jay Elliot, who was hired by Jobs after a chance meeting in a restaurant, noted Jobs's salient trait: "His obsession is a passion for the product, a passion for product perfection.", Mike Scott, on the other hand, never let a passion for the perfect take precedence over pragmatism
The design of the Apple II case was one of many examples.
The Pantone company, which Apple used to specify colors for its plastic, had more than two thousand shades of beige.
"None of them were good enough for Steve," Scott marveled.
"He wanted to create a different shade, and I had to stop him."
When the time came to tweak the design of the case, Jobs spent days agonizing over just how rounded the corners should be.
"I did n't care how rounded they were," said Scott, "I just wanted it decided.", Another dispute was over engineering benches
Scott wanted a standard gray; Jobs insisted on special - order benches that were pure white.
All of this finally led to a showdown in front of Markkula about whether Jobs or Scott had the power to sign purchase orders; Markkula sided with Scott.
Jobs also insisted that Apple be different in how it treated customers , He wanted a one - year warranty to come with the Apple II
This flabbergasted Scott; the usual warranty was ninety days.
Again Jobs dissolved into tears during one of their arguments over the issue.
They walked around the parking lot to calm down, and Scott decided to relent on this one.
But as pressure on the economy continues to mount, the political system itself has come into question from businesses and the Vietnamese people.
Avalanche Traps More Than 100 Pakistani Soldiers
The country's institutions have failed to endorse major reforms, he added.
"Everyone knows it's time for another strategy, but they know they do n't have the political structure that is coherent enough."
Wozniak quickly embraced the idea of hiring Scott.
Like Markkula, he hated dealing with the conflicts that Jobs engendered.
Jobs, not surprisingly, had more conflicted emotions.
"I was only twenty - two, and I knew I was n't ready to run a real company," he said.
He finally acquiesced, reluctantly.
It was evidence of general distrust, he said, and the authorities "have more work to do to show they deserve the mandate" of the people.
He instead worked on finding ways that a donated Apple II and a VisiCalc program could make it easier for the foundation to do a survey it was planning on blindness in Nepal.
His biggest personal gift was to his parents, Paul and Clara Jobs, to whom he gave about $750,000 worth of stock , They sold some to pay off the mortgage on their Los Altos home, and their son came over for the little celebration
"It was the first time in their lives they did n't have a mortgage," Jobs recalled.
"They had a handful of their friends over for the party, and it was really nice.", Still, they did n't consider buying a nicer house.
"They were n't interested in that," Jobs said.
I watched people at Apple who made a lot of money and felt they had to live differently.
Some of them bought a Rolls - Royce and various houses, each with a house manager and then someone to manage the house managers.
Their wives got plastic surgery and turned into these bizarre people.
This was not how I wanted to live.
It's crazy.
I made a promise to myself that I'm not going to let this money ruin my life.
Where Does the Money Go?
Clearly, the People's Liberation Army (PLA) has been on a spending spree for the past 15 years, but where does all this increased defence spending go?
The Chinese insist that these increases in defence spending mostly go to addressing PLA quality - of - life issues: soldiers' pay and benefits, building new barracks, etc., but this is patently false.
For more than a decade, Chinese defence white papers have consistently stated that approximately one - third of all military expenditures goes to personnel, one - third to operations, and one - third to "equipment," i.e., defence research and development (R&D) and procurement.
Since these ratios have remained more or less constant since the late 1990s, this means that any increases in spending must be shared out equally among the three segments of the military budget.
In a country still marked by a culture of opacity inherited from years of war, the true situation is difficult to determine.
And when even the official picture is far from rosy - with barely eight weeks worth of foreign exchange reserves and fears over the level of bad debts held by public banks - the lack of visibility is worrying.
Burge finally agreed to drive out to the Jobs garage.
"Holy Christ, this guy is going to be something else," he recalled thinking , "What's the least amount of time I can spend with this clown without being rude."
Then, when he was confronted with the unwashed and shaggy Jobs, two things hit him: "First, he was an incredibly smart young man.
Second, I did n't understand a fiftieth of what he was talking about. "
Al Jazeera reports temperatures in Kashmir drop as low as negative 94 degrees Fahrenheit at night.
Although the region is hotly contested by Pakistan and India, in the last 18 years, more soldiers at the buried base have died from weather - related incidents than from gunfire.
LONDON – Is China poised to become the world's next superpower?
This question is increasingly asked as China's economic growth surges ahead at more than 8% a year, while the developed world remains mired in recession or near - recession.
China is already the world's second largest economy, and will be the largest in 2017.
And its military spending is racing ahead of its GDP growth.
Jobs's primary test for recruiting people in the spring of 1981 to be part of his merry band of pirates was making sure they had a passion for the product.
He would sometimes bring candidates into a room where a prototype of the Mac was covered by a cloth, dramatically unveil it, and watch.
"If their eyes lit up, if they went right for the mouse and started pointing and clicking, Steve would smile and hire them," recalled Andrea Cunningham.
As he typed on his keyboard, colorful lines and swirls burst on the screen across the room.
The only outsider who saw this first Apple II was the hotel's technician.
He said he had looked at all the machines, and this was the one he would be buying.
"We would have to literally put him out the door and tell him to go take a shower," said Markkula.
"At meetings we had to look at his dirty feet."
Sometimes, to relieve stress, he would soak his feet in the toilet, a practice that was not as soothing for his colleagues.
By the fall of 1979 Apple was breeding three ponies to be potential successors to the Apple II workhorse.
There was the ill - fated Apple III , There was the Lisa project, which was beginning to disappoint Jobs
And somewhere off Jobs's radar screen, at least for the moment, there was a small skunkworks project for a low - cost machine that was being developed by a colorful employee named Jef Raskin, a former professor who had taught Bill Atkinson.
Raskin's goal was to make an inexpensive "computer for the masses" that would be like an appliance - a self - contained unit with computer, keyboard, monitor, and software all together - and have a graphical interface . He tried to turn his colleagues at Apple on to a cutting - edge research center, right in Palo Alto, that was pioneering such ideas
When they moved back to Los Altos, their relationship drifted into being, for the most part, merely friendly.
He lived at home and worked at Atari; she had a small apartment and spent a lot of time at Kobun Chino's Zen center.
By early 1975 she had begun a relationship with a mutual friend, Greg Calhoun.
"She was with Greg, but went back to Steve occasionally," according to Elizabeth Holmes.
We were sort of shifting back and forth; it was the seventies, after all. "
In September Chuck Peddle of the Commodore computer company came by the Jobs house to get a demo.
"We'd opened Steve's garage to the sunlight, and he came in wearing a suit and a cowboy hat," Wozniak recalled.
Peddle loved the Apple II, and he arranged a presentation for his top brass a few weeks later at Commodore headquarters.
"You might want to buy us for a few hundred thousand dollars," Jobs said when they got there.
That month the Homebrew surveyed its members and found that, of the 181 who owned personal computers, only six owned an Apple.
Jobs was convinced, however, that the Apple II would change that.
Markkula would become a father figure to Jobs.
Like Jobs's adoptive father, he would indulge Jobs's strong will, and like his biological father, he would end up abandoning him.
"Markkula was as much a father - son relationship as Steve ever had," said the venture capitalist Arthur Rock.
He began to teach Jobs about marketing and sales.
"Mike really took me under his wing," Jobs recalled.
"His values were much aligned with mine.
He emphasized that you should never start a company with the goal of getting rich.
Your goal should be making something you believe in and making a company that will last. "
Mike Scott, called "Scotty" to distinguish him from Mike Markkula, had one primary duty: managing Jobs.
"My very first walk was to tell him to bathe more often," Scott recalled.
"He said that in exchange I had to read his fruitarian diet book and consider it as a way to lose weight."
Scott never adopted the diet or lost much weight, and Jobs made only minor modifications to his hygiene.
"Steve was adamant that he bathed once a week, and that was adequate as long as he was eating a fruitarian diet.", Jobs's desire for control and disdain for authority was destined to be a problem with the man who was brought in to be his regent, especially when Jobs discovered that Scott was one of the only people he had yet encountered who would not bend to his will
"The question between Steve and me was who could be most stubborn, and I was pretty good at that," Scott said.
"He needed to be sat on, and he sure did n't like that."
Jobs later said, "I never yelled at anyone more than I yelled at Scotty."
Jobs was furious that the computer cases had arrived with tiny blemishes on them, so he had his handful of employees sand and polish them.
The imputing even extended to gussying up Jobs and Wozniak.
Markkula sent them to a San Francisco tailor for three - piece suits, which looked faintly ridiculous on them, like tuxes on teenagers.
"Markkula explained how we would all have to dress up nicely, how we should appear and look, how we should act," Wozniak recalled.
It was worth the effort.
The Apple II looked solid yet friendly in its sleek beige case, unlike the intimidating metal - clad machines and naked boards on the other tables.
Apple got three hundred orders at the show, and Jobs met a Japanese textile maker, Mizushima Satoshi, who became Apple's first dealer in Japan.
Wozniak was stunned by this "ridiculous" suggestion, but Jobs persisted.
The Commodore honchos called a few days later to say they had decided it would be cheaper to build their own machine.
Jobs was not upset.
He had checked out Commodore and decided that its leadership was "sleazy."
Wozniak did not rue the lost money, but his engineering sensibilities were offended when the company came out with the Commodore PET nine months later.
"It kind of sickened me.
They made a real crappy product by doing it so quick.
They could have had Apple.
The Commodore flirtation brought to the surface a potential conflict between Jobs and Wozniak: Were they truly equal in what they contributed to Apple and what they should get out of it?
Jerry Wozniak, who exalted the value of engineers over mere entrepreneurs and marketers, thought most of the money should be going to his son.
Jobs began to cry, which was not unusual.
"If we're not fifty - fifty," he said to his friend, "you can have the whole thing."
Wozniak, however, understood better than his father the symbiosis they had.
If it had not been for Jobs, he might still be handing out schematics of his boards for free at the back of Homebrew meetings.
It was Jobs who had turned his ingenious designs into a budding business, just as he had with the Blue Box.
He agreed they should remain partners.
He had always been temperamental and bratty.
At Atari his behavior had caused him to be banished to the night shift, but at Apple that was not possible.
'"He was particularly rough on Wozniak's young programmers, Randy Wigginton and Chris Espinosa.
Baby You're a Rich Man
Before and after he was rich, and indeed throughout a life that included being both broke and a billionaire, Steve Jobs's attitude toward wealth was complex.
He was an antimaterialistic hippie who capitalized on the inventions of a friend who wanted to give them away for free, and he was a Zen devotee who made a pilgrimage to India and then decided that his calling was to create a business.
He had a great love for some material objects, especially those that were finely designed and crafted, such as Porsche and Mercedes cars, Henckels knives and Braun appliances, BMW motorcycles and Ansel Adams prints, Bösendorfer pianos and Bang & Olufsen audio equipment.
Yet the houses he lived in, no matter how rich he became, tended not to be ostentatious and were furnished so simply they would have put a Shaker to shame.
"The soldiers were stationed at a camp near the glacier where the avalanche hit.
So far, at least a dozen bodies have been recovered.
The high elevation and harsh weather conditions are making recovery operations difficult and dangerous. "
They both knew what to look for.
They agreed that Tesler could show off Smalltalk, the programming language, but he would demonstrate only what was known as the "unclassified" version.
Goldberg stormed out in a rage.
The authorities have upped interest rates to try to cool the economy and choke off speculation, piling intense pressure on small - and medium - sized firms with lenders now charging upwards of 20 per cent.
So I decided to nab some of his people who were really good, like Atkinson, bring in some of my own, take the thing over and build a less expensive Lisa, not some piece of junk. ", Some on the team found Jobs impossible to work with
"Jobs seems to introduce tension, politics, and hassles rather than enjoying a buffer from those distractions," one engineer wrote in a memo to Raskin in December 1980.
This alone is bad management, but if the idea is a good one he will soon be telling people about it as though it was his own.
The first step in this process was convincing the Valley's premier publicist, Regis McKenna, to take on Apple as a client.
McKenna was from a large working - class Pittsburgh family, and bred into his bones was a steeliness that he cloaked with charm.
A college dropout, he had worked for Fairchild and National Semiconductor before starting his own PR and advertising firm.
His two specialties were doling out exclusive interviews with his clients to journalists he had cultivated and coming up with memorable ad campaigns that created brand awareness for products such as microchips.
One of these was a series of colorful magazine ads for Intel that featured racing cars and poker chips rather than the usual dull performance charts.
Instead he was transferred to Frank Burge, an account executive, who tried to put him off.
Jobs called back almost every day.
The analyst Chi Lo lucidly presents a picture of macro success alongside micro failure.
The huge stimulus of RMB 4 trillion ($586 billion) in November 2008, mostly poured into loss - making state - owned enterprises via directed bank lending, sustained China's growth in the face of global recession.
But the price was an increasingly serious misallocation of capital, resulting in growing portfolios of bad loans, while excessive Chinese household savings have inflated real - estate bubbles.
Moreover, Chi argues that the crisis of 2008 shattered China's export - led growth model, owing to prolonged impairment of demand in the advanced countries.
The California courts ordered Jobs to start paying $385 a month in child support, sign an agreement admitting paternity, and reimburse the county $5,856 in back welfare payments.
He was given visitation rights but for a long time did n't exercise them.
Even then Jobs continued at times to warp the reality around him.
Worse yet, when Chrisann Brennan later heard what he said, she mistakenly thought that Jobs was hyperbolically claiming that she might have slept with 28% of the men in the United States.
By early 1981 the Mac team had grown to about twenty, and Jobs decided that they should have bigger quarters.
So he moved everyone to the second floor of a brown - shingled, two - story building about three blocks from Apple's main offices.
It was next to a Texaco station and thus became known as Texaco Towers.
In order to make the office more lively, he told the team to buy a stereo system.
"Burrell and I ran out and bought a silver, cassette - based boom box right away, before he could change his mind," recalled Hertzfeld , Jobs's triumph was soon complete
A few weeks after winning his power struggle with Raskin to run the Mac division, he helped push out Mike Scott as Apple's president.
Scotty had become more and more erratic, alternately bullying and nurturing.
He finally lost most of his support among the employees when he surprised them by imposing a round of layoffs that he handled with atypical ruthlessness.
Dawn of a New Age
An Integrated Package
The benchmark VN - Index at the Ho Chi Minh City stock exchange, opened with great fanfare in 2000, slumped to just 383 points in August this year, barely a third of its peak in 2007 after Vietnam joined the World Trade Organisation.
While haunting the appliance aisles at Macy's, he was struck by the Cuisinart food processors and decided that he wanted a sleek case made of light molded plastic.
At a Homebrew meeting, he offered a local consultant, Jerry Manock, $1,500 to produce such a design , Manock, dubious about Jobs's appearance, asked for the money up front
Jobs refused, but Manock took the job anyway.
Within weeks he had produced a simple foam - molded plastic case that was uncluttered and exuded friendliness.
Jobs was thrilled.
Next came the power supply.
Digital geeks like Wozniak paid little attention to something so analog and mundane, but Jobs decided it was a key component.
Richard A. Bitzinger is a Senior Fellow with the Military Transformations Programme at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies (RSIS), Nanyang Technological University.
Formerly with the RAND Corp. and the Asia - Pacific Centre for Security Studies, he has been writing on military and defence economic issues for more than 20 years.
The second problem is one of political values.
China's further "ascent" will depend on dismantling such classic communist policy icons as public - asset ownership, population control, and financial repression.
The question remains how far these reforms will be allowed to go before they challenge the Communist Party's political monopoly, guaranteed by the 1978 constitution.
This graphical user interface - or GUI, pronounced "gooey" - was facilitated by another concept pioneered at Xerox PARC: bitmapping.
Until then, most computers were character - based.
You would type a character on a keyboard, and the computer would generate that character on the screen, usually in glowing greenish phosphor against a dark background.
Since there were a limited number of letters, numerals, and symbols, it did n't take a whole lot of computer code or processing power to accomplish this.
In a bitmap system, on the other hand, each and every pixel on the screen is controlled by bits in the computer's memory.
Jobs and his team went to a Xerox dealer to look at the Star as soon as it was released.
But he deemed it so worthless that he told his colleagues they could n't spend the money to buy one.
"We knew they had n't done it right, and that we could - at a fraction of the price.", A few weeks later he called Bob Belleville, one of the hardware designers on the Xerox Star team
The Xerox Corporation's Palo Alto Research Center, known as Xerox PARC, had been established in 1970 to create a spawning ground for digital ideas.
It was safely located, for better and for worse, three thousand miles from the commercial pressures of Xerox corporate headquarters in Connecticut.
Among its visionaries was the scientist Alan Kay, who had two great maxims that Jobs embraced: "The best way to predict the future is to invent it" and "People who are serious about software should make their own hardware.", Kay pushed the vision of a small personal computer, dubbed the "Dynabook," that would be easy enough for children to use
So Xerox PARC's engineers began to develop user - friendly graphics that could replace all of the command lines and DOS prompts that made computer screens intimidating.
HO - CHI - MINH CITY - As Vietnam battles galloping inflation and a plummeting currency, a new challenge has emerged - a general collapse of confidence in the state's ability to heal the ailing economy.
With Apple's success came fame for its poster boy.
Inc. became the first magazine to put him on its cover, in October 1981.
It showed Jobs with a neatly trimmed beard and well - styled long hair, wearing blue jeans and a dress shirt with a blazer that was a little too satiny , He was leaning on an Apple II and looking directly into the camera with the mesmerizing stare he had picked up from Robert Friedland
"When Steve Jobs speaks, it is with the gee - whiz enthusiasm of someone who sees the future and is making sure it works," the magazine reported , Time followed in February 1982 with a package on young entrepreneurs
Jobs, said the main story, "practically singlehanded created the personal computer industry."
The accompanying profile, written by Michael Moritz, noted, "At 26, Jobs heads a company that six years ago was located in a bedroom and garage of his parents' house, but this year it is expected to have sales of $600 million...
Beyond this basic effort to acquire military strength for the sake of great - power status, it is obvious that China intends to use this new - found military power to advance its national interests.
Key among these are its territorial claims in the South China Sea or protecting local sea lanes of communication vital to its energy supplies and trade; increasing pressure on Taiwan not to declare independence and to eventually accept some kind of reunification with the mainland; and to counter the rising American military presence in the Asia - Pacific – if not to establish itself as a credible rival to the US in this region.
Such a division of the spoils has clearly benefited defence R&D and procurement.
In 1997, for example, spending on equipment totaled some 25.6 billion yuan (approximately US$ 3 billion at the time), or roughly 32 percent of the overall Chinese defence budget.
In 2009, the equipment budget was still around 32 percent of a total military budget of 400 billion yuan (US$ 58.8 billion) – and keep in mind that most Western militaries spend on average less than 20 percent of their budgets on equipment.
If this roughly one - third percentage rate remains constant for the 2012 budget, then PLA expenditures for defence R&D and procurement this year are probably somewhere in the neighbourhood of US$ 35 billion.
For the rest of his career, Jobs would understand the needs and desires of customers better than any other business leader, he would focus on a handful of core products, and he would care, sometimes obsessively, about marketing and image and even the details of packaging.
"When you open the box of an iPhone or iPad, we want that tactile experience to set the tone for how you perceive the product," he said.
"Mike taught me that."
It's not as if Xerox executives ignored what their scientists had created at PARC.
In fact they did try to capitalize on it, and in the process they showed why good execution is as important as good ideas.
In 1981, well before the Apple Lisa or Macintosh, they introduced the Xerox Star, a machine that featured their graphical user interface, mouse, bitmapped display, windows, and desktop metaphor.
Years later, when I asked about the name, Jobs admitted simply, "Obviously it was named for my daughter."
China's new defence budget – particularly given the sizable and growing funding it dedicates to military R&D and procurement – demonstrates Beijing's continuing resolve to gain military power commensurate with its growing soft power.
In other words, Chinese spending on military equipment has grown more than ten-fold over the past 15 years – although with inflation the real increase is probably closer to six-fold.
This growth in the equipment budget has permitted the PLA to significantly expand its acquisition of modern military equipment, including fourth - generation combat aircraft (such as the J - 10 and locally built Su - 27 fighters), new frigates and destroyers, and several types of nuclear – and conventionally powered submarines.
The CBC says - as of Saturday evening in Kashmir - no soldiers have been found alive, but a few casualties have been reported.
To render something on the screen, such as a letter, the computer has to tell each pixel to be light or dark or, in the case of color displays, what color to be.
This uses a lot of computing power, but it permits gorgeous graphics, fonts, and gee - whiz screen displays.
Bitmapping and graphical interfaces became features of Xerox PARC's prototype computers, such as the Alto, and its object - oriented programming language, Smalltalk.
Jef Raskin decided that these features were the future of computing.
So he began urging Jobs and other Apple colleagues to go check out Xerox PARC.
But he was not at a high enough level to be cut in on the stock options that were awarded before the IPO.
A Man of Wealth and Fame
Wozniak, not surprisingly, had the opposite attitude.
Before the shares went public, he decided to sell, at a very low price, two thousand of his options to forty different midlevel employees.
Most of his beneficiaries made enough to buy a home.
Wozniak bought a dream home for himself and his new wife, but she soon divorced him and kept the house.
He also later gave shares outright to employees he felt had been shortchanged, including Kottke, Fernandez, Wigginton, and Espinosa.
Everyone loved Wozniak, all the more so after his generosity, but many also agreed with Jobs that he was "awfully naive and childlike."
A few months later a United Way poster showing a destitute man went up on a company bulletin board , Someone scrawled on it "Woz in 1990."
There was still, to be sure, a childlike rebellious streak in him.
Even his initial stirrings of domesticity had some quirks.
He bought a proper house in the Los Gatos hills, which he adorned with a Maxfield Parrish painting, a Braun coffeemaker, and Henckels knives.
At first he hoped that the Apple III would play that role.
It would have more memory, the screen would display eighty characters across rather than forty, and it would handle uppercase and lowercase letters.
Indulging his passion for industrial design, Jobs decreed the size and shape of the external case, and he refused to let anyone alter it, even as committees of engineers added more components to the circuit boards.
The result was piggybacked boards with poor connectors that frequently failed.
When the Apple III began shipping in May 1980, it flopped.
Randy Wigginton, one of the engineers, summed it up: "The Apple III was kind of like a baby conceived during a group orgy, and later everybody had this bad headache, and there's this bastard child, and everyone says, ‘ It's not mine.
At first he flirted with the idea of touchscreens, but he found himself frustrated.
Apple's engineers devised an interface so you could not only drag windows and files around, you could even drop them into folders.
The Xerox system required you to select a command in order to do anything, ranging from resizing a window to changing the extension that located a file.
The Apple system transformed the desktop metaphor into virtual reality by allowing you to directly touch, manipulate, drag, and relocate things.
And Apple's engineers worked in tandem with its designers - with Jobs spurring them on daily - to improve the desktop concept by adding delightful icons and menus that pulled down from a bar atop each window and the capability to open files and folders with a double click.
China's New Defence Budget: What Does It Tell Us , – Analysis
Just how high are the troops trapped?
Sky News gives us a glimpse.
In particular he wanted - as he would his entire career - to provide power in a way that avoided the need for a fan.
Fans inside computers were not Zen - like; they distracted.
He dropped by Atari to consult with Alcorn, who knew old - fashioned electrical engineering.
"Al turned me on to this brilliant guy named Rod Holt, who was a chain - smoking Marxist who had been through many marriages and was an expert on everything," Jobs recalled.
Like Manock and others meeting Jobs for the first time, Holt took a look at him and was skeptical.
"I'm expensive," Holt said.
Jobs sensed he was worth it and said that cost was no problem.
"He just conned me into working," said Holt, who ended up joining Apple full - time.
Instead of a conventional linear power supply, Holt built one like those used in oscilloscopes.
It switched the power on and off not sixty times per second, but thousands of times; this allowed it to store the power for far less time, and thus throw off less heat.
"That switching power supply was as revolutionary as the Apple II logic board was," Jobs later said.
"Rod does n't get a lot of credit for this in the history books, but he should.
Every computer now uses switching power supplies, and they all rip off Rod's design. ", For all of Wozniak's brilliance, this was not something he could have done
"I only knew vaguely what a switching power supply was," Woz admitted.
Not only is China now the world's second largest in terms of military expenditures, it greatly outspends every other country except the US.
China overtook Japan in 2007 as the largest defence spender in Asia, and then the world's number two - ranked United Kingdom in 2008.
China's new defence budget is more than twice as large as the third - highest spenders (a rough tie between the UK, France, and Russia, according to data provided by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute).
It outspends all of Southeast Asia's militaries combined by a factor of better than three to one, and China's defence expenditures are nearly three times that of its rising Asian rival, India.
"We have n't been able to establish contact with anyone inside, but we are trying from various areas to approach the exact location... So, we are keeping our fingers crossed on that."
"I totally trusted Steve, and I assumed he would take care of me like I'd taken care of him, so I did n't push," said Kottke , The official reason he was n't given stock options was that he was an hourly technician, not a salaried engineer, which was the cutoff level for options
Even so, he could have justifiably been given "founder's stock," but Jobs decided not to.
"Steve is the opposite of loyal," according to Andy Hertzfeld, an early Apple engineer who has nevertheless remained friends with him , "He's anti-loyal"
His first job was to develop a program to track a stock portfolio by auto - dialing the Dow Jones service, getting quotes, then hanging up.
"I had to create it fast because there was a magazine ad for the Apple II showing a hubby at the kitchen table looking at an Apple screen filled with graphs of stock prices, and his wife is beaming at him - but there was n't such a program, so I had to create one."
Jobs had resisted, thinking that BASIC was all the Apple II needed, but he told Atkinson, "Since you're so passionate about it, I'll give you six days to prove me wrong."
He did, and Jobs respected him ever after.
When the Xerox PARC meeting ended after more than two hours, Jobs drove Bill Atkinson back to the Apple office in Cupertino.
He was speeding, and so were his mind and mouth , "This is it!"
The star of the team was a blond, cherubic, and psychologicallyintense self - taught young engineer named Burrell Smith, who worshipped the code work of Wozniak and tried to pull off similar dazzling feats.
China is the only major country to experience double - digit real (i.e., after taking inflation into account) increases in military expenditures nearly every year since the end of the Cold War.
China's defence budget has risen, on average, 13 percent annually for the past fifteen years, resulting in a 500 percent or greater real increase in military expenditures since 1997.
Consequently, the phenomenon of large increases in Chinese defence spending, especially since they have been constant and consistent for more than a decade and a half, is a genuine cause for concern; China may be increasingly prone to using its growing military power to achieve, or underpin its efforts to achieve, its expressed national goals.
Speaking to CNN, General Abbas says communications with the troops buried under the avalanche have been completely severed.
The ruling Communist Party, which has total control in the one - party nation, announced an overhaul of its economic model during a five - yearly congress in January and a slew of monetary and tax austerity measures have followed.
Jobs's father had once taught him that a drive for perfection meant caring about the craftsmanship even of the parts unseen.
Jobs applied that to the layout of the circuit board inside the Apple II , he rejected the initial design because the lines were not straight enough
This passion for perfection led him to indulge his instinct to control.
Most hackers and hobbyists liked to customize, modify, and jack various things into their computers.
To Jobs, this was a threat to a seamless end - to - end user experience.
Wozniak, a hacker at heart, disagreed , he wanted to include eight slots on the Apple II for users to insert whatever smaller circuit boards and peripherals they might want
Jobs insisted there be only two, for a printer and a modem.
"Usually I'm really easy to get along with, but this time I told him, 'If that's what you want, go get yourself another computer,'" Wozniak recalled.
As Jobs walked the floor of the Personal Computer Festival, he came to the realization that Paul Terrell of the Byte Shop had been right: Personal computers should come in a complete package.
The next Apple, he decided, needed to have a great case and a built - in keyboard, and be integrated end to end, from the power supply to the software.
"My vision was to create the first fully packaged computer," he recalled.
"We were no longer aiming for the handful of hobbyists who liked to assemble their own computers, who knew how to buy transformers and keyboards.
For every one of them there were a thousand people who would want the machine to be ready to run. "
There was a disturbing irony.
Jobs and Brennan were both twenty - three, the same age that Joanne Schieble and Abdulfattah Jandali had been when they had Jobs.
He had not yet tracked down his biological parents, but his adoptive parents had told him some of their tale.
"I did n't know then about this coincidence of our ages, so it did n't affect my discussions with Chrisann," he later said.
He dismissed the notion that he was somehow following his biological father's pattern of getting his girlfriend pregnant when he was twenty - three, but he did admit that the ironic resonance gave him pause.
"When I did find out that he was twenty - three when he got Joanne pregnant with me, I thought, whoa!"
Markkula offered to guarantee a line of credit of up to $250,000 in return for being made a one - third equity participant.
Apple would incorporate, and he along with Jobs and Wozniak would each own 26% of the stock.
The rest would be reserved to attract future investors.
The three met in the cabana by Markkula's swimming pool and sealed the deal.
"I thought it was unlikely that Mike would ever see that $250,000 again, and I was impressed that he was willing to risk it," Jobs recalled.
Now it was necessary to convince Wozniak to come on board full - time.
Markkula said that would n't work, and he gave Wozniak a deadline of a few days to decide.
"I felt very insecure in starting a company where I would be expected to push people around and control what they did," Wozniak recalled.
"I'd decided long ago that I would never become someone authoritative.", So he went to Markkula's cabana and announced that he was not leaving HP
But neither choice is a scenario for China "replacing" the US.
Nor, I think, is this what China wants.
Its goal is respect, not dominance.
China now urgently needs to rebalance its economy by shifting from public investment and exports towards public and private consumption.
In the short run, some of its savings need to be invested in real assets abroad, and not just parked in US Treasuries.
But, in the longer term, Chinese households' excessive propensity to save must be reduced by developing a social safety net and consumer credit instruments.
"Vietnam is kind of stuck producing the same sort of things... more and more coffee, rice, cashew, paper, shirts and shoes - and is having trouble moving into higher value - added production, a lot of which is therefore imported from China," he said.
More nervous laughter, and only one or two hands went up.
Later Jobs would complain about the new generation of kids, who seemed to him more materialistic and careerist than his own , "When I went to school, it was right after the sixties and before this general wave of practical purposefulness had set in," he said
"Now students are n't even thinking in idealistic terms, or at least nowhere near as much.", His generation, he said, was different
"The idealistic wind of the sixties is still at our backs, though, and most of the people I know who are my age have that ingrained in them forever."
Neither then nor later would he travel with an entourage, keep a personal staff, or even have security protection , He bought a nice car, but always drove himself
When Markkula asked Jobs to join him in buying a Lear jet, he declined (though he eventually would demand of Apple a Gulfstream to use).
Like his father, he could be flinty when bargaining with suppliers, but he did n't allow a craving for profits to take precedence over his passion for building great products.
Thirty years after Apple went public, he reflected on what it was like to come into money suddenly: I never worried about money.
I grew up in a middle - class family, so I never thought I would starve.
And I learned at Atari that I could be an okay engineer, so I always knew I could get by.
I was voluntarily poor when I was in college and India, and I lived a pretty simple life even when I was working.
So I went from fairly poor, which was wonderful, because I did n't have to worry about money, to being incredibly rich, when I also did n't have to worry about money.
"He asked me if I would put $50,000 in and he would give me a third of the company," said Bushnell.
"I was so smart, I said no.
It's kind of fun to think about that, when I'm not crying. ", Bushnell suggested that Jobs try Don Valentine, a straight - shooting former marketing manager at National Semiconductor who had founded Sequoia Capital, a pioneering venture capital firm
Valentine arrived at the Jobses' garage in a Mercedes wearing a blue suit, button - down shirt, and rep tie , His first impression was that Jobs looked and smelled odd
"Steve was trying to be the embodiment of the counterculture.
Valentine, however, did not become a preeminent Silicon Valley investor by relying on surface appearances.
What bothered him more was that Jobs knew nothing about marketing and seemed content to peddle his product to individual stores one by one.
"If you want me to finance you," Valentine told him, "you need to have one person as a partner who understands marketing and distribution and can write a business plan."
Jobs tended to be either bristly or solicitous when older people offered him advice.
"Send me three suggestions," he replied.
Valentine did, Jobs met them, and he clicked with one of them, a man named Mike Markkula, who would end up playing a critical role at Apple for the next two decades.
Two important cultural values underpin China's political system.
The first is the hierarchical and familial character of Chinese political thought.
Chinese philosophers acknowledge the value of spontaneity, but within a strictly ordered world in which people know their place.
As the Analects of Confucius puts it: "Let the ruler be a ruler, the subject a subject, a father a father, and a son a son."
A few days after Raskin left, Jobs appeared at the cubicle of Andy Hertzfeld, a young engineer on the Apple II team, who had a cherubic face and impish demeanor similar to his pal Burrell Smith's.
Hertzfeld recalled that most of his colleagues were afraid of Jobs "because of his spontaneous temper tantrums and his proclivity to tell everyone exactly what he thought, which often was n't very favorable."
But Hertzfeld was excited by him.
"Are you any good?", Jobs asked the moment he walked in
"We only want really good people working on the Mac, and I'm not sure you're good enough.", Hertzfeld knew how to answer
"I told him that yes, I thought that I was pretty good."
That afternoon Scott called in Jobs and Raskin for a showdown in front of Markkula.
Jobs started crying , He and Raskin agreed on only one thing: Neither could work for the other one
On the Lisa project, Scott had sided with Couch.
This time he decided it was best to let Jobs win.
After all, the Mac was a minor development project housed in a distant building that could keep Jobs occupied away from the main campus.
Raskin was told to take a leave of absence.
"They wanted to humor me and give me something to do, which was fine," Jobs recalled.
"It was like going back to the garage for me.
I had my own ragtag team and I was in control. "
This time it was the normally shy Wozniak who became prickly.
McKenna glanced at an article Wozniak was writing about Apple and suggested that it was too technical and needed to be livened up.
"I do n't want any PR man touching my copy," Wozniak snapped.
McKenna suggested it was time for them to leave his office.
"But Steve called me back right away and said he wanted to meet again," McKenna recalled.
So an art director, Rob Janoff, was assigned to create a new one.
On a visit to a Stanford class, he took off his Wilkes Bashford blazer and his shoes, perched on top of a table, and crossed his legs into a lotus position.
The students asked questions, such as when Apple's stock price would rise, which Jobs brushed off.
"How many of you have taken LSD?"
"At an altitude of around 6,000 meters, 20,000 feet, that in itself posing something of a challenge for rescue parties who are on their way today."
Jobs became contemptuous of people who made a display of philanthropy or thinking they could reinvent it.
Earlier he had quietly sent in a $5,000 check to help launch Larry Brilliant's Seva Foundation to fight diseases of poverty, and he even agreed to join the board.
But when Brilliant brought some board members, including Wavy Gravy and Jerry Garcia, to Apple right after its IPO to solicit a donation, Jobs was not forthcoming.
One of the engineers told Atkinson that there was no way to build such a mouse commercially.
After Atkinson complained to Jobs over dinner, he arrived at the office the next day to discover that Jobs had fired the engineer.
When his replacement met Atkinson, his first words were, "I can build the mouse.", Atkinson and Jobs became best friends for a while, eating together at the Good Earth most nights
But John Couch and the other professional engineers on his Lisa team, many of them buttoned - down HP types, resented Jobs's meddling and were infuriated by his frequent insults.
By the time Apple went public a year later, Xerox's $1 million worth of shares were worth $17.6 million , But Apple got the better end of the bargain
Jobs and his colleagues went to see Xerox PARC's technology in December 1979 and, when Jobs realized he had n't been shown enough, got an even fuller demonstration a few days later.
Larry Tesler was one of the Xerox scientists called upon to do the briefings, and he was thrilled to show off the work that his bosses back east had never seemed to appreciate.
"What is happening in Vietnam is a crisis of confidence," a foreign investor in the southern business hub Ho Chi Minh City told AFP.
Markkula made a wild prediction: "We're going to be a Fortune 500 company in two years," he said.
"This is the start of an industry , It happens once in a decade."
It would take Apple seven years to break into the Fortune 500, but the spirit of Markkula's prediction turned out to be true.
The First Launch Event
The introduction of the Apple II was scheduled to coincide with the first West Coast Computer Faire, to be held in April 1977 in San Francisco, organized by a Homebrew stalwart, Jim Warren.
Jobs signed Apple up for a booth as soon as he got the information packet.
He wanted to secure a location right at the front of the hall as a dramatic way to launch the Apple II, and so he shocked Wozniak by paying $5,000 in advance , "Steve decided that this was our big launch," said Wozniak
"We would show the world we had a great machine and a great company."
XEROX AND LISA
Graphical User Interfaces
In his excitement, Jobs began to take over the daily management of the Lisa project, which was being run by John Couch, the former HP engineer.
Ignoring Couch, he dealt directly with Atkinson and Tesler to insert his own ideas, especially on Lisa's graphical interface design.
"He would call me at all hours, 2 a.m. or 5 a.m.," said Tesler.
One important showdown occurred when Atkinson decided that the screen should have a white background rather than a dark one.
This would allow an attribute that both Atkinson and Jobs wanted: WYSIWYG, pronounced "wiz - ee - wig," an acronym for "What you see is what you get."
What you saw on the screen was what you'd get when you printed it out.
"The hardware team screamed bloody murder," Atkinson recalled.
"They said it would force us to use a phosphor that was a lot less persistent and would flicker more."
So Atkinson enlisted Jobs, who came down on his side.
The hardware folks grumbled, but then went off and figured it out.
"Steve was n't much of an engineer himself, but he was very good at assessing people's answers , He could tell whether the engineers were defensive or unsure of themselves."
Kottke decided to press his case with Jobs by hovering outside his office and catching him to make a plea.
But at each encounter, Jobs brushed him off , "What was really so difficult for me is that Steve never told me I was n't eligible," recalled Kottke
"He owed me that as a friend.
When I would ask him about stock, he would tell me I had to talk to my manager. ", Finally, almost six months after the IPO, Kottke worked up the courage to march into Jobs's office and try to hash out the issue
But when he got in to see him, Jobs was so cold that Kottke froze.
"I just got choked up and began to cry and just could n't talk to him," Kottke recalled.
"Our friendship was all gone.
It was so sad. "
Ever since they had lived together in a cabin during the summer after he graduated from high school, Chrisann Brennan had woven in and out of Jobs's life.
When he returned from India in 1974, they spent time together at Robert Friedland's farm.
"Steve invited me up there, and we were just young and easy and free," she recalled.
"There was an energy there that went to my heart."
There is also very little belief in the sanctity of human life: Buddhism holds that there is no difference between humans and animals and plants.
A pledge to protect human rights was written into the Chinese constitution in 2004; but, as the recent case of the blind dissident Chen Guangcheng illustrates, this is mostly a dead letter.
Similarly, private property ranks below collective property.
Jobs was enthralled by Raskin's vision, but not by his willingness to make compromises to keep down the cost.
At one point in the fall of 1979 Jobs told him instead to focus on building what he repeatedly called an 'insanely great' product.
'Do n't worry about price, just specify the computer's abilities,' Jobs told him , Raskin responded with a sarcastic memo
It spelled out everything you would want in the proposed computer: a high - resolution color display, a printer that worked without a ribbon and could produce graphics in color at a page per second, unlimited access to the ARPA net, and the capability to recognize speech and synthesize music, "even simulate Caruso singing with the Mormon tabernacle choir, with variable reverberation."
The memo concluded, "Starting with the abilities desired is nonsense.
We must start both with a price goal, and a set of abilities, and keep an eye on today's and the immediate future's technology. ", In other words, Raskin had little patience for Jobs's belief that you could distort reality if you had enough passion for your product
What Raskin did n't know was that Jobs was working on a more complex deal.
Xerox's venture capital division wanted to be part of the second round of Apple financing during the summer of 1979.
Do n't you sell it to your good customers?
If so, how can you charge me a 7% commission?
Hambrecht recognized that there was a basic unfairness in the system, and he later went on to formulate the idea of a reverse auction to price shares before an IPO.
Apple went public the morning of December 12, 1980.
By then the bankers had priced the stock at $22 a share.
It went to $29 the first day.
Jobs had come into the Hambrecht & Quist office just in time to watch the opening trades . At age twenty - five, he was now worth $256 million
A Sign of Resolve
In its continuing adherence to annual double - digit increases in military spending, as well as its allocating a large portion of its defence budget to R&D and procurement, it is clear that Beijing is seeking to gain 'hard' power – that is, military strength - commensurate with its growing economic, diplomatic, and cultural 'soft' power.
Raskin's former student Bill Atkinson sided with Jobs.
They both wanted a powerful processor that could support whizzier graphics and the use of a mouse.
'Steve had to take the project away from Jef,' Atkinson said.
Jef was pretty firm and stubborn, and Steve was right to take it over.
The world got a better result. The disagreements were more than just philosophical; they became clashes of personality
"I think that he likes people to jump when he says jump," Raskin once said.
Merry Christmas and Happy New Year 2012
The first conflict was over Raskin's devotion to the underpowered Motorola 6809 microprocessor.
Once again it was a clash between Raskin's desire to keep the Mac's price under $1,000 and Jobs's determination to build an insanely great machine.
Just before Christmas 1980, he challenged Burrell Smith, without telling Raskin, to make a redesigned prototype that used the more powerful chip.
As his hero Wozniak would have done, Smith threw himself into the task around the clock, working nonstop for three weeks and employing all sorts of breathtaking programming leaps.
When he succeeded, Jobs was able to force the switch to the Motorola 68000, and Raskin had to brood and recalculate the cost of the Mac.
Vietnam economic reform faces crisis of confidence
This is way over the top.
In fact, the existence of a single superpower is highly abnormal, and was brought about only by the unexpected collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.
The normal situation is one of coexistence, sometimes peaceful sometimes warlike, between several great powers.
Pakistani soldiers are digging into an avalanche that buried at least 117 troops in the Himalayas.
The rescue operation is underway on the Siachen glacier - that in the disputed Kashmir region.
Robert Friedland came to her rescue.
"He heard that I was pregnant, and he said to come on up to the farm to have the baby," she recalled.
"So I did.", Elizabeth Holmes and other friends were still living there, and they found an Oregon midwife to help with the delivery
On May 17, 1978, Brennan gave birth to a baby girl.
Three days later Jobs flew up to be with them and help name the new baby , The practice on the commune was to give children Eastern spiritual names, but Jobs insisted that she had been born in America and ought to have a name that fit
Brennan agreed.
They named her Lisa Nicole Brennan, not giving her the last name Jobs.
And then he left to go back to work at Apple.
"He did n't want to have anything to do with her or with me," said Brennan.
When Jobs was looking for someone to write a manual for the Apple II in 1976, he called Raskin, who had his own little consulting firm.
Since Raskin thought it was sexist to name computers after women, he redubbed the project in honor of his favorite type of apple, the McIntosh.
But he changed the spelling in order not to conflict with the name of the audio equipment maker McIntosh Laboratory , The proposed computer became known as the Macintosh
The Apple II would be marketed, in various models, for the next sixteen years, with close to six million sold.
More than any other machine, it launched the personal computer industry.
Wozniak deserves the historic credit for the design of its awe - inspiring circuit board and related operating software, which was one of the era's great feats of solo invention.
But Jobs was the one who integrated Wozniak's boards into a friendly package, from the power supply to the sleek case , He also created the company that sprang up around Wozniak's machines
As Regis McKenna later said, 'Woz designed a great machine, but it would be sitting in hobby shops today were it not for Steve Jobs.'
Nevertheless most people considered the Apple II to be Wozniak's creation.
That would spur Jobs to pursue the next great advance, one that he could call his own.
To produce the fully packaged Apple II would require significant capital, so they considered selling the rights to a larger company.
Jobs went to Al Alcorn and asked for the chance to pitch it to Atari's management.
He set up a meeting with the company's president, Joe Keenan, who was a lot more conservative than Alcorn and Bushnell.
'Steve goes in to pitch him, but Joe could n't stand him,' Alcorn recalled.
'He did n't appreciate Steve's hygiene.'
Jobs was barefoot, and at one point put his feet up on a desk.
There goes that possibility.
Even though her relationship with Jobs was sporadic, Brennan soon moved in as well.
This made for a set of living arrangements worthy of a French farce.
The house had two big bedrooms and two tiny ones.
Living in the house at times rekindled the physical relationship between Brennan and Jobs, and within a few months she was pregnant.
The price to be paid is enormous.
There are already a certain number of corpses on the pavement.
But while he said the measures were "necessary", others are wondering if they will be enough.
IN early March, China released its defence budget for 2012, which broke the symbolic US$ 100 billion barrier for the first time.
In fact, Chinese military expenditures will total US$ 106.4 billion (S$ 134 billion), an increase of 11.2 percent over 2011 – and this does not include possible hidden spending, which could add billions of dollars per year to the Chinese defence budget.
There was no discussion of marriage.
She thought about it repeatedly and decided not to, or I do n't know that she ever really decided - I think time just decided for her.
Brennan told me that it was her choice to have the baby: 'He said he was fine with an abortion but never pushed for it.'
Interestingly, given his own background, he was adamantly against one option.
'He strongly discouraged me putting the child up for adoption,' she said.
On a cold New Year's Eve, a poor girl tries to sell matches in the street.
She is freezing badly, but she is afraid to go home because her father will beat her for not selling any matches.
She takes shelter in a nook and lights the matches to warm herself.
In their glow, she sees several lovely visions including a Christmas tree and a holiday feast.
The girl looks skyward, sees a shooting star, and remembers her deceased grandmother saying that such a falling star means someone died and is going into Heaven.
As she lights her next match, she sees a vision of her grandmother, the only person to have treated her with love and kindness.
She strikes one match after another to keep the vision of her grandmother nearby for as long as she can.
The child dies and her grandmother carries her soul to Heaven.
The next morning, passers - by find the dead child in the nook.
Wozniak began to rankle at Jobs's style.
Steve was too tough on people.
I wanted our company to feel like a family where we all had fun and shared whatever we made , Jobs, for his part, felt that Wozniak simply would not grow up
He was very childlike.
He did a great version of BASIC, but then never could buckle down and write the floating - point BASIC we needed, so we ended up later having to make a deal with Microsoft.
He was just too unfocused, but for the time being the personality clashes were manageable, mainly because the company was doing so well
Ben Rosen, the analyst whose newsletters shaped the opinions of the tech world, became an enthusiastic proselytizer for the Apple II.
An independent developer came up with the first spreadsheet and personal finance program for personal computers, VisiCalc, and for a while it was available only on the Apple II, turning the computer into something that businesses and families could justify buying.
The company began attracting influential new investors.
The pioneering venture capitalist Arthur Rock had initially been unimpressed when Markkula sent Jobs to see him.
'He looked as if he had just come back from seeing that guru he had in India,' Rock recalled, 'and he kind of smelled that way too.'
But after Rock scoped out the Apple II, he made an investment and joined the board.
Both Mike Scott and Mike Markkula were intent on bringing some order to Apple and became increasingly concerned about Jobs's disruptive behavior.
So in September 1980, they secretly plotted a reorganization.
Couch was made the undisputed manager of the Lisa division.
'I was upset and felt abandoned by Markkula,' he said.
He and Scotty felt I was n't up to running the Lisa division.
I brooded about it a lot.
It was an application of Markkula's admonition that it was important to 'impute' your greatness by making a memorable impression on people, especially when launching a new product.
That was reflected in the care that Jobs took with Apple's display area.
Other exhibitors had card tables and poster board signs.
Apple had a counter draped in black velvet and a large pane of backlit Plexiglas with Janoff's new logo.
They put on display the only three Apple IIs that had been finished, but empty boxes were piled up to give the impression that there were many more on hand.
With Wozniak, 1981 Options When Mike Markkula joined Jobs and Wozniak to turn their fledgling partnership into the Apple Computer Co. in January 1977, they valued it at $5,309 , less than four years later they decided it was time to take it public
It would become the most oversubscribed initial public offering since that of Ford Motors in 1956.
China has a choice: it can either accept Western values, or it can try to carve out an East Asian sphere to insulate itself from them.
The latter course would provoke conflict not only with the US, but also with other Asian powers, particularly Japan and India.
China's best possible future thus probably lies in accepting Western norms while trying to flavor them with "Chinese characteristics."
On paper he looked like a great choice.
He was running a manufacturing line for National Semiconductor, and he had the advantage of being a manager who fully understood engineering.
In person, however, he had some quirks.
He was overweight, afflicted with tics and health problems, and so tightly wound that he wandered the halls with clenched fists.
He also could be argumentative.
In dealing with Jobs, that could be good or bad.
Bruce Horn was one of the programmers at Xerox PARC.
When some of his friends, such as Larry Tesler, decided to join the Macintosh group, Horn considered going there as well.
But he got a good offer, and a $15,000 signing bonus, to join another company.
'You have to come into Apple tomorrow morning,' he said.
'I have a lot of stuff to show you.'
'Steve was so passionate about building this amazing device that would change the world,' Horn recalled.
'By sheer force of his personality, he changed my mind.', Jobs showed Horn exactly how the plastic would be molded and would fit together at perfect angles, and how good the board was going to look inside
Wow, I said, I do n't see that kind of passion every day.
So I signed up. Jobs even tried to reengage Wozniak
"I resented the fact that he had not been doing much, but then I thought, hell, I would n't be here without his brilliance," Jobs later told me , But as soon as Jobs was starting to get him interested in the Mac, Wozniak crashed his new single - engine Beechcraft while attempting a takeoff near Santa Cruz
He barely survived and ended up with partial amnesia.
Jobs spent time at the hospital, but when Wozniak recovered he decided it was time to take a break from Apple.
Ten years after dropping out of Berkeley, he decided to return there to finally get his degree, enrolling under the name of Rocky Raccoon Clark.
Then there is the Confucian doctrine of the "mandate of heaven," by which political rule is legitimized.
Today, the mandate of Marxism has taken its place, but neither has any room for a mandate of the people.
﻿Ambivalence about the source of legitimate government is not only a major obstacle to democratization, but is also a potential source of political instability.
The Lisa was conceived as a $2,000 machine based on a sixteen - bit microprocessor, rather than the eight - bit one used in the Apple II.
Without the wizardry of Wozniak, who was still working quietly on the Apple II, the engineers began producing a straightforward computer with a conventional text display, unable to push the powerful microprocessor to do much exciting stuff.
For example, Great Britain, whose place the US is often said to have taken, was never a "superpower" in the American sense.
Despite its far - flung empire and naval supremacy, nineteenth - century Britain could never have won a war against France, Germany, or Russia without allies.
Britain was, rather, a world power – one of many historical empires distinguished from lesser powers by the geographic scope of their influence and interests.
It was a smart call.
To make the Apple II successful required more than just Wozniak's awesome circuit design.
It would need to be packaged into a fully integrated consumer product, and that was Jobs's role.
He began by asking their erstwhile partner Ron Wayne to design a case.
'I assumed they had no money, so I did one that did n't require any tooling and could be fabricated in a standard metal shop,' he said.
His design called for a Plexiglas cover attached by metal straps and a rolltop door that slid down over the keyboard.
Jobs did n't like it , He wanted a simple and elegant design, which he hoped would set Apple apart from the other machines, with their clunky gray metal cases
The sensible question, then, is not whether China will replace the US, but whether it will start to acquire some of the attributes of a world power, particularly a sense of responsibility for global order.
The question is reasonable enough if we do n't give it an American twist.
To the American mind, there can be only one superpower, so China's rise will automatically be at the expense of the United States.
Indeed, for many in the US, China represents an existential challenge.
Thus they were destined to clash, especially after Jobs was ejected from the Lisa project in September 1980 and began casting around for someplace else to make his mark.
It was inevitable that his gaze would fall on the Macintosh project.
Dominic Scriven, general manager at Dragon Capital, said the last five years have seen Vietnam's economic model "go out of balance".
"The question is does everybody realise that and are the measures put in place sufficient to restore the balance?"
But the other briefer, Adele Goldberg, was appalled that her company seemed willing to give away its crown jewels.
"It was incredibly stupid, completely nuts, and I fought to prevent giving Jobs much of anything," she recalled.
Goldberg got her way at the first briefing.
Jobs, Raskin, and the Lisa team leader John Couch were ushered into the main lobby, where a Xerox Alto had been set up.
When Jobs did not want to deal with a distraction, he sometimes just ignored it, as if he could will it out of existence.
At times he was able to distort reality not just for others but even for himself.
In the case of Brennan's pregnancy, he simply shut it out of his mind.
When confronted, he would deny that he knew he was the father, even though he admitted that he had been sleeping with her.
"I was n't sure it was my kid, because I was pretty sure I was n't the only one she was sleeping with," he told me later.
"She and I were not really even going out when she got pregnant.
She just had a room in our house.
"Great Artists Steal" The Apple raid on Xerox PARC is sometimes described as one of the biggest heists in the chronicles of industry.
Jobs occasionally endorsed this view, with pride.
As he once said, "Picasso had a saying - 'good artists copy, great artists steal' - and we have always been shameless about stealing great ideas.", Another assessment, also sometimes endorsed by Jobs, is that what transpired was less a heist by Apple than a fumble by Xerox
"They were copier - heads who had no clue about what a computer could do," he said of Xerox's management.
They just grabbed defeat from the greatest victory in the computer industry.
Xerox could have owned the entire computer industry, both assessments contain a lot of truth, but there is more to it than that
There falls a shadow, as T.S.Eliot noted, between the conception and the creation.
In the annals of innovation, new ideas are only part of the equation , Execution is just as important
Brennan had no doubt that Jobs was the father.
She had not been involved with Greg or any other men at the time.
Was he lying to himself, or did he not know that he was the father?
"I just think he could n't access that part of his brain or the idea of being responsible," Kottke said.
Elizabeth Holmes agreed: "He considered the option of parenthood and considered the option of not being a parent, and he decided to believe the latter.
A year after Lisa was born, Jobs agreed to take a paternity test.
Brennan's family was surprised, but Jobs knew that Apple would soon be going public and he decided it was best to get the issue resolved.
DNA tests were new, and the one that Jobs took was done at UCLA.
"I had read about DNA testing, and I was happy to do it to get things settled," he said.
"Probability of paternity is 94.41%," the report read.
Jobs was not naive, he had made sure his deal with Chrisann Brennan was signed before the IPO occurred
Jobs was the public face of the IPO, and he helped choose the two investment banks handling it: the traditional Wall Street firm Morgan Stanley and the untraditional boutique firm Hambrecht & Quist in San Francisco.
Jef Raskin was the type of character who could enthrall Steve Jobs - or annoy him.
A philosophical guy who could be both playful and ponderous, Raskin had studied computer science, taught music and visual arts, conducted a chamber opera company, and organized guerrilla theater.
His 1967 doctoral thesis at U.C. San Diego argued that computers should have graphical rather than text - based interfaces.
When he got fed up with teaching, he rented a hot air balloon, flew over the chancellor's house, and shouted down his decision to quit.
Rod Holt, the engineer who had built the power supply, was getting a lot of options, and he tried to turn Jobs around , "We have to do something for your buddy Daniel," he said, and he suggested they each give him some of their own options
I will give him zero.
Recent signs are that foreign and local businesses have yet to be convinced.
Pledged foreign direct investment into Vietnam slumped by almost a quarter in the first ten months of the year, to US$ 11.3 billion, according to official figures.
Apple was now a real company, with a dozen employees, a line of credit, and the daily pressures that can come from customers and suppliers.
It had even moved out of the Jobses' garage, finally, into a rented office on Stevens Creek Boulevard in Cupertino, about a mile from where Jobs and Wozniak went to high school.
In their hotel room on that Labor Day weekend of 1976, Wozniak tinkered with the prototype of the new machine, to be named the Apple II, that Jobs hoped would take them to this next level.
They brought the prototype out only once, late at night, to test it on the color projection television in one of the conference rooms.
Wozniak had come up with an ingenious way to goose the machine's chips into creating color, and he wanted to see if it would work on the type of television that uses a projector to display on a movie - like screen.
"I figured a projector might have a different color circuitry that would choke on my color method," he recalled, "So I hooked up the Apple II to this projector and it worked perfectly."
In fact the folks at PARC had never accomplished it, and they later told him they were amazed that he had done so.
"I got a feeling for the empowering aspect of naïveté," Atkinson said.
"Because I did n't know it could n't be done, I was enabled to do it.", He was working so hard that one morning, in a daze, he drove his Corvette into a parked truck and nearly killed himself
Jobs immediately drove to the hospital to see him.
"We were pretty worried about you," he said when Atkinson regained consciousness , Atkinson gave him a pained smile and replied, "Do n't worry, I still remember regions."
Markkula shrugged and said okay.
By this point Wozniak's father had realized there was real money to be made by capitalizing on the Apple II, and he joined forces on Jobs's behalf.
"I started getting phone calls at work and home from my dad, my mom, my brother, and various friends," Wozniak recalled.
"Every one of them told me I'd made the wrong decision."
Then Allen Baum, their Buck Fry Club mate at Homestead High, called , "You really ought to go ahead and do it," he said
He argued that if he joined Apple full - time, he would not have to go into management or give up being an engineer.
"That was exactly what I needed to hear," Wozniak later said.
"I could stay at the bottom of the organization chart, as an engineer."
He called Jobs and declared that he was now ready to come on board.
Even ordinary Vietnamese have shown nervousness over the economic future, ditching the currency in favour of the relative safe havens of gold and dollars in recent months - a move echoed by some banks which, according to one source, have profited handsomely by speculating against the dong.
In 2008, as financial turmoil swept the globe, Vietnamese authorities responded by injecting massive liquidity into the economy, and speculative bubbles multiplied.
Business confidence has fallen for three consecutive quarters in 2011, according to a survey by the European Chamber of Commerce published earlier this month.
"The measures taken to stabilise the economy have so far failed to ease the concern of the business community about the macroeconomic outlook," the group said.
Raskin's ouster may not have seemed fair, but it ended up being good for the Macintosh.
Raskin wanted an appliance with little memory, an anemic processor, a cassette tape, no mouse, and minimal graphics.
Unlike Jobs, he might have been able to keep the price down to close to $1,000, and that may have helped Apple win market share.
But he could not have pulled off what Jobs did, which was to create and market a machine that would transform personal computing.
In fact we can see where the road not taken led.
Raskin was hired by Canon to build the machine he wanted.
"It was the Canon Cat, and it was a total flop," Atkinson said.
Nobody wanted it.
Experts predict the pain will continue for at least another 18 months.
After a while their relationship frayed, and they returned from India separately.
By the summer of 1977 Brennan had moved back to Los Altos, where she lived for a while in a tent on the grounds of Kobun Chino's Zen center.
By this time Jobs had moved out of his parents' house and was renting a $600 per month suburban ranch house in Cupertino with Daniel Kottke.
It was an odd scene of free - spirited hippie types living in a tract house they dubbed Rancho Suburbia.
"It was a four - bedroom house, and we occasionally rented one of the bedrooms out to all sorts of crazy people, including a stripper for a while," recalled Jobs.
Kottke could n't quite figure out why Jobs had not just gotten his own house, which he could have afforded by then.
"I think he just wanted to have a roommate," Kottke speculated.
Theirs was a serious trip, beginning in March 1976 and lasting almost a year.
At one point they ran out of money, so Calhoun hitchhiked to Iran to teach English in Tehran.
The relationship between Jobs and Brennan quickly deteriorated.
"Chrisann would get into this kind of victim mode, when she would say that Steve and I were ganging up on her," Kottke recalled , "Steve would just laugh and not take her seriously."
Brennan was not, as even she later admitted, very emotionally stable.
She began breaking plates, throwing things, trashing the house, and writing obscene words in charcoal on the wall.
She said that Jobs kept provoking her with his callousness: "He was an enlightened being who was cruel.", Kottke was caught in the middle
"Daniel did n't have that DNA of ruthlessness, so he was a bit flipped by Steve's behavior," according to Brennan.
"He would go from ‘ Steve's not treating you right 'to laughing at me with Steve."
Now Vietnam is trying to bring down Asia's highest rate of inflation - nearly 22 per cent year - on - year in October - trim its trade deficit and strengthen the dong, which has seen four devaluations in 15 months.
Even posed in this more modest way, the question does not admit of a clear answer.
The first problem is China's economy, so dynamic on the surface, but so rickety underneath.
Hertzfeld explained that he needed to get his Apple II DOS program in good enough shape to hand it over to someone.
"You're just wasting your time with that!", Jobs replied
Who cares about the Apple II?
The Apple II will be dead in a few years.
The Macintosh is the future of Apple, and you're going to start on it now!
With that, Jobs yanked out the power cord to Hertzfeld's Apple II, causing the code he was working on to vanish.
"Come with me," Jobs said.
I'm going to take you to your new desk.
Jobs drove Hertzfeld, computer and all, in his silver Mercedes to the Macintosh offices.
"Here's your new desk," he said, plopping him in a space next to Burrell Smith.
"Welcome to the Mac team!", The desk had been Raskin's
In fact Raskin had left so hastily that some of the drawers were still filled with his flotsam and jetsam, including model airplanes.
With an eye on the brash success of neighbouring China, Vietnam's obsessive pursuit of growth lasted for two decades until economic threats forced it to shift attention to stability this year.
There was also a clash of visions.
Jobs wanted to build a VolksLisa, a simple and inexpensive product for the masses.
"There was a tug - of - war between people like me, who wanted a lean machine, and those from HP, like Couch, who were aiming for the corporate market," Jobs recalled.
And with rescue efforts underway, BBC World News spoke with Major - General Athar Abbas, a spokesman for the Pakistani military.
Abbas says, even by Himalayan standards, this is a big avalanche.
The fancy clothes and Markkula's injunctions could not, however, stop the irrepressible Wozniak from playing some practical jokes.
One program that he displayed tried to guess people's nationality from their last name and then produced the relevant ethnic jokes.
He also created and distributed a hoax brochure for a new computer called the "Zaltair," with all sorts of fake ad - copy superlatives like "Imagine a car with five wheels."
Jobs briefly fell for the joke and even took pride that the Apple II stacked up well against the Zaltair in the comparison chart.
He did n't realize who had pulled the prank until eight years later, when Woz gave him a framed copy of the brochure as a birthday gift.
It's a natural disaster on the highest battleground in the world.
An estimated 15,000 Pakistani and Indian soldiers reside on the Siachen glacier in the border region of Kashmir.
Al Jazeera reports more than 100 Pakistani troops found themselves trapped on that glacier Saturday.
When Tesler finally showed them what was truly under the hood, the Apple folks were astonished.
Atkinson stared at the screen, examining each pixel so closely that Tesler could feel the breath on his neck.
Jobs bounced around and waved his arms excitedly.
"I ca n't believe Xerox is not taking advantage of this.", The Smalltalk demonstration showed three amazing features
One was how computers could be networked; the second was how object - oriented programming worked.
But Jobs and his team paid little attention to these attributes because they were so amazed by the third feature, the graphical interface that was made possible by a bitmapped screen.
"It was like a veil being lifted from my eyes," Jobs recalled.
"I could see what the future of computing was destined to be."
More importantly, perhaps, military R&D spending has likely increased just as dramatically.
Assuming a low average of 5 percent of overall defence spending being dedicated to defence R&D (similar to what the leading West European powers spend in this category), the Chinese could be allocating approximately US$ 6 billion a year to developing new weapons systems and researching new technologies – and this amount could easily be higher.
In fact, the PLA already appears to be reaping the benefits of higher R&D spending, given the unveiling of its J - 20 "fifth - generation" fighter, an antiship ballistic missile, and the stealthy, catamaran - hulled Houbei - class fast missile boat.
Other computers had been named after daughters of their designers, but Lisa was a daughter Jobs had abandoned and had not yet fully admitted was his.
"Maybe he was doing it out of guilt," said Andrea Cunningham, who worked at Regis McKenna on public relations for the project.
